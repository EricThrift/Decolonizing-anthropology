Smith's book&nbsp;<i>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{tuhiwai2013}</cite> is a well-known text that is not limited to anthropology, but that identifies different ways that research can be conducted by and with Indigenous peoples in ways that respect Indigenous needs and rights. </div><div>In a Canadian context, UBC anthropologist Charles Menzies has suggested a list of strategies for ethnographic research conducted "with, for, and among Indigenous peoples"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{menzies2001reflections}</cite>. </div><div>Central to both of these works is the premise that research must be truly collaborative from its inception, with research questions and priorities set in association with local communities, instead of operating in an extractive or merely consultative mode. Identifying Indigenous communities as partners and collaborators (e.g.,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{ridington2013happiness}</cite>) implies a substantially different relationship between anthropologists and collaborators than is suggested for conventional participant observation, in which the ethnographer is a privileged subject whose role is to understand, and report on, "the natives"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{malinowski2002argonauts}</cite>.</div><h1 data-label="502040" class="ltx_title_section">Decolonization Through Autoethnography</h1><div>                                      </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthropology’s origins are deeply rooted in colonialism, a fact that has  shaped discourse within the discipline through generations. While anthropology  has greatly shifted away from its initial colonial ideals, it can be argued  that anthropology is inadvertently still colonial. Unfortunately, Canadian anthropology  is no exception to this pattern. Cha Throughout this essay, autoethnography, which is an  individual’s study or account of their own culture, will be examined as a  potential remedy to colonialism in anthropology. This will be done by looking  at how autoethnography challenges conventional anthropology’s physical  presence, and how autoethnography intersects with public anthropology to resist  colonial values. To supplement this discussion, the autoethnographic works of Robert  F. Murphy, Julie Cruikshank, and Joel Martineau will be examined. Following  this, several common criticisms of autoethnography will be disputed. Over the  course of this essay it will be argued &nbsp;that autoethnography is an ideal means of  decolonization, physically and epistemologically. While this methodology does  not specifically target Canadian anthropology, some Canadian autoethnographic  works have been selected to show how it has decolonized Canadian anthropology. </div><div>            </div>
