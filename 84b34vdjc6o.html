Smith's book&nbsp;<i>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{tuhiwai2013}</cite> is a well-known text that is not limited to anthropology, but that identifies different ways that research can be conducted by and with Indigenous peoples in ways that respect Indigenous needs and rights. </div><div>In a Canadian context, UBC anthropologist Charles Menzies has suggested a list of strategies for ethnographic research conducted "with, for, and among Indigenous peoples"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{menzies2001reflections}</cite>. </div><div>Central to both of these works is the premise that research must be truly collaborative from its inception, with research questions and priorities set in association with local communities, instead of operating in an extractive or merely consultative mode.

While anthropology  has greatly shifted away from its initial colonial ideals, it can be argued  that anthropology is inadvertently still colonial. Unfortunately, Canadian anthropology  is no exception to this pattern. Challenging these colonial values can be a difficult task. Throughout this essay, autoethnography, which is an  individual’s study or account of their own culture, will be examined as a  potential remedy to colonialism in anthropology. This will be done by looking  at how autoethnography challenges conventional anthropology’s physical  presence, and how autoethnography intersects with public anthropology to resist  colonial values. To supplement this discussion, the autoethnographic works of Robert  F. Murphy, Julie Cruikshank, and Joel Martineau will be examined. Following  this, several common criticisms of autoethnography will be disputed. Over the  course of this essay it will be argued &nbsp;that autoethnography is an ideal means of  decolonization, physically and epistemologically. While this methodology does  not specifically target Canadian anthropology, some Canadian autoethnographic  works have been selected to show how it has decolonized Canadian anthropology.&nbsp;To understand how to challenge the presence of colonialism in anthropology we must first understand how anthropology has been colonial in the past.                                          &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central to the discipline of anthropology is fieldwork. &nbsp;Tullio Maranhão goes as far as to say that  fieldwork is the defining feature of the “anthropologist’s métier” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{maranho1986}</cite>.  While fieldwork has laid the foundation of modern anthropological theory and  practice, colonial undercurrents can often be found, rendering some methods of fieldwork  problematic. Aleksandar Bošković and Thomas Hylland Eriksen state that western  anthropology is colonial in nature because of the focus it places foreign  cultures <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2013}</cite>. Essentially, anthropology has been colonial as it has  combined the values of fieldwork with foreign cultures, reinforcing colonial  power balances. Epitomizing the colonial themes encapsulated in fieldwork are  Marius Barbeau and Bronislaw Malinowski. A brief examination of the fieldwork  of these anthropologists will draw attention to how autoethnography can be used  to combat some challenges that arise from anthropological fieldwork. It is  important to note that these anthropologists were chosen not for their  anachronistic nature, but because their fieldwork, while prolific and greatly  influential, was harmful to the cultures they studied. </div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marius Barbeau, a Canadian salvage ethnographer, reinforces a colonial power balance through his fieldwork. In the early 20th century Barbeau collected and archived Indigenous cultures that he believed were on the brink of extinction (Nurse 2011, 52). Through his preservation efforts Barbeau assumed the role of a cultural curator, where he arbitrated the (in)authentic (Ibid, 53). This method of fieldwork is colonial because it polarizes power between the Indigenous people and the anthropologist. Barbeau often disregarded the information locals provided to him, deeming that their cultural insight was inferior to his understanding (Ibid, 56). Through this Barbeau creates a dichotomous power relationship, where he is the authoritative figure on a culture despite his brief immersion into it, and that because of this he controlled what was genuine. In short, Barbeau distorted and dismissed contemporary culture by deciphering culture’s authenticity through his “intuition” (Ibid, 61). Despite his problematic fieldwork, Barbeau made great contributions to archiving culture and championed early anthropology’s strive to salvage culture perceived to be at risk. </div><div>        </div><div>            </div>
