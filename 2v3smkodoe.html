<div>&nbsp;<b>Educational Anthropology</b></div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  potential of educational anthropology could be seen in the early 1800’s with  anthropologists being involved in early curriculum development but it did not  take hold as a field of specialization until the late 19th century.  The majority of the development, it has been argued&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eddy1987}</cite>, took place  during the 1920’s, coinciding with the rise in professionalism in the field of  anthropology. Elizabeth Eddy, a prominent educational anthropologist in the  United States, divides the history of educational anthropology into two  sections: the Formative Years, 1925-1954, and the Institutionalization and  Specialization Years, 1955-present. During the Formative Years, several themes  were emphasized; generalizations of human development made by Freud, Piaget,  and Watson, were challenged, and the eugenics movement was refuted. &nbsp;Anthropologists were involved in a number of  commissions established by the Progressive Education Association throughout the  1930’s. Funded by the General Education Board and the Carneige Corporation,  these studies included the development of proposals and material for revising  the social studies curriculum in secondary schools and the initiation of  intensive study of adolescents.&nbsp; Furthermore,  during the 1930’s, several American anthropologists were involved in addressing  the educational problems of Native Americans as employees of the Bureau of  Indian Affairs. These anthropologists wrote historical and ethnographic texts  and developed orthographies for use in schools. Many prominent anthropologists  have been involved in the development of educational anthropology, such as  Malinowski, Radcliffe-Brown, and Mead. Malinowski worked in Africa training  anthropologists, missionaries, and educators in ethnographic field methods, and  applying them to educational problems. In 1934, Malinowski addressed the New  Education Fellowship in South Africa who were “deeply committed to the need of  Western educators to take indigenous native systems of education into account  when formulating educational policies” (Eddy 1987, p.12). &nbsp;During the same year, Radcliffe-Brown lectured  at the “Education and Culture Contacts” conference at Yale which consisted of  attendees from the West Indes, India, Philippines, Great Britain, China, and  the United States. The major theme of the conference was “the need to adapt  education to individual and community needs rather than to transfer Western  educational practices wholesale”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eddy1987}</cite>p.12.&nbsp;</div><div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mead was also  involved in the organization of a conference that brought together education  and anthropology in 1949. Funded by the Carnegie Corporation, “The Educational  Problems of Special Cultural Groups” conference held at the Teachers College in  New York was attended by colonial educators from British African territories  and American educators from the south to discuss the education of African  Americans. This conference was a turning point in that the methods and problems  of education in the south were no longer being applied to those in Africa.  Instead, each should be addressed and studied individually (Eddy 1987). Mead’s  most influential work,&nbsp;<i>Coming of Age in  Samoa</i>, was also influenced by educational anthropology. Psychologists and  educators were attempting to understand the struggles of youth and why they  were not adjusting to the changes taking place, and to create resources to  help. Mead, however, believed that psychology was inadequate to provide a  complete understanding and focused her work on what she considered a simpler  society that she believed would make analysis more easily possible. In&nbsp;<b>Samoa</b>, Mead studied the development and  lives of&nbsp;<b>adolescent girls</b>, finding  that&nbsp;<b>adolescence&nbsp;</b>in&nbsp;<b>Samoa</b> was not analogous to that in the  United States (Mead 2017). Mead’s work in&nbsp;<b>Samoa &nbsp;</b>exemplifies the trends in educational anthropology leading up to the  Stanford Conference, focusing on childhood and youth, and where the  anthropological work was not a part of an institutionalized process, but was  dependent on the individuals <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eddy1987}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1954 marks the end  of what Eddy terms “the formative years” of educational anthropology, with the  Stanford Conference that looked to address the future cooperation of education  and anthropology. Educational anthropology still did not formally exist at this  time, nor was it the purpose of the conference to create the sub-field. Four  themes were the focus of the conference: “the search for a philosophical as  well as a theoretical articulation of education, the necessity for  sociocultural contextualization of the educative process, the relation of  education to ‘culturally phrased’ phases of the life cycle, and the nature of  intercultural understanding and learning” (Eddy 1987, p. 13-14). The Stanford  Conference was the beginning of the formalization of the subfield of  educational anthropology, a notion that was furthered by the postwar growth in  the discipline during the 1960’s. While applied anthropology declined during  the 1960’s, it was during this time that anthropology received its first  federal support for curriculum development and discipline oriented teacher  training. A number of other projects that linked education and anthropology  were undertaken throughout the decade: Anthropology Curriculum Study Project  (1962), Man: A Course of Study, and the Teacher’s Resources in Urban Education  Project. In 1965 the Culture of Schools program was initiated under Stanley  Diamond as a collaboration between anthropologists and behavioral scientists to  develop foundations for research in American mass education. This resulted in  the Program in Anthropology and Education directed by Fred Gearing. These  programs were important in the national visibility of what was becoming  educational anthropology. The formal institutionalization of educational  anthropology as a field of specialization concluded in 1970 with the  organization of the Council on Anthropology and Education, followed by the journal &nbsp;<i>Anthropology and Education Quarterly&nbsp;</i>in  1977<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Eddy1987}</cite>. Much of the history of educational anthropology has been an  attempt to move away from colonial practices but has still been colonial in  nature. The involvement of colonial educators and anthropologists in  conferences, the themes of which often focused on localizing the education for  the needs of individual communities instead of generalizations, demonstrates  the desire to create educational systems that are founded on local knowledge  and practices but are nonetheless still undertaken through Western methods. In  Canadian anthropology, the colonial influence in educational anthropology can  be seen through the study of residential schools.&nbsp;</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PhD candidate  Peter Sindell conducted an anthropological study of the effects of a  residential school on the cultural identities of Cree students at a school in  Quebec from July 1966 to September 1967. Sindell studied 13 Cree children who  had all been raised in “traditional” Cree homes before attending La Tuque  Residential School, operated by Anglican Church of Canada for the Indian  Affairs Board. La Tuque Residential School opened in 1963 and was located 180  Miles northeast of Montreal. Through interviews with the children, parents, and  teachers before, during, and after attending school, a series of behavioral  rating forms administered by counsellors and teachers, and observational  protocols, Sindell determined that most students experience a conflict in  identity in later years from alternating between the residential school and the  trading post where they were raised . While in this study Sindell  does not make any recommendations for solving the problem of the disassociation  of identity nor does he partake in curriculum formation, it is an excellent  example of the colonial background of educational anthropology in Canada. Despite  the colonial background of both education and anthropology in Canada, strides  are being made to work toward decolonization. Current trends in curriculum  development and educational anthropology in Canada have the decolonization of  education as a central theme.&nbsp;<b>Current Trends</b></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovations in  educational ethnography have showcased the ways in which ethnography can shed  light on the educational process. Currently, educational researchers are  applying ethnographic tools to their work and forming strong relationships with  ethnographers. The benefits from these partnerships have included cultural  dialogue being built into curricula, and the cultural training of educators,  who, with the use of ethnographic tools, are able to “analyze their own  reactions reflexively” (Hammond and Spindler 2006, p. xviii).</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across Canada,  curricula development has come to focus on the incorporation social justice and  ecological and indigenous perspectives over recent years (Stanley and Young  2011). These three themes work together toward decolonizing Canadian education  and anthropologists have played a key role in this. William Pinar summarizes  the current trends in curriculum development as “the concept of decolonization-  not only of Indigenous Peoples, but of Canadians of European decent as well-  seems to summarize the pressing curricular concern” (Pinar 2011, p. 7).&nbsp; This has become a pressing concern because of  the systematic racism that is the legacy of the colonization of Canada and the  Residential Schools that followed. Families have been torn apart and damaged,  and students traumatized resulting in cycles of internalized colonization  evidenced by high rates of suicide and incarceration and low rates of  graduation and achievement in school. One way that this can be addressed is  through the reconciliation of Treaty rights to education and the incorporation  of Indigenous Knowledge into curricula (Battiste 2011). The development of curricula  has not been free from politics because of the government and corporate funding  for education, conferences, and projects, such as those that early educational  anthropologists were involved in. Indigenous Knowledge focusses on holistic  development: intellectual, spiritual, emotional, and physical, and is necessary  for the survival of Indigenous people in Canada (Bell 2011). What were  life-long learning practices based on the ecological needs of the community  included language and oral traditions, community socialization, ceremonies and  relationships, are now being incorporated into curricula to confront hidden  standards of racism and colonialism in what has attempted to be a culturally  sensitive and authentic manner (Battiste 2011). </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indigenous  thought is founded “on a deep understanding that we all live in relation to the  land” (Ng-A-Fook 2011, p.315). Therefore, environmental education must become a  key component of curricula. Kulnieks, Longboat, and Young (2011) argue that all  education needs to become environmental education in order to rectify the  separation between humans and the natural world. To do this, Indigenous ways of  knowing, not Indigenous culture must be applied to the classrooms. This can be  accomplished through inquiry into personal and cultural histories, and  interaction with the natural landscape such as with the practice of growing  food, learning medicinal, edible and lethal plants. Thus, a shift from learning  about nature to learning from nature will take place (Kulnieks, Longboat, and  Young 2011). Ng-A-Fook accomplished this through engaging his students in  creating social action based curriculum, addressing the gab between what was  learned in the classroom and the knowledge used for everyday living through  knowledge from lived experiences. His students worked with Algonquian Elders to  create a curriculum for the Kitigan Zibi community to incorporate the  Algonquian language and knowledge into the everyday lives of the students. They  worked to create a curricular space of discourse and action (Ng-A-Fook 2011). Land-based  activities, exposure to traditional practices, and incorporation of Indigenous  knowledge are all ways that educators can work toward providing experiences  that will benefit all students. Using the Medicine Wheel as an educational  framework with teachings and pedagogical application can provide the holistic  education necessary to the survival of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Positive  cultural identity among Indigenous youth is linked to happiness in school and  more academic success (Bell 2011). Erickson Collegiate Institute is a prime example  of how these curricular trends have been incorporated into the school. </div><div>    <b>Rolling River School Division Case Study</b></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling  River School Division is a small school division in western Manitoba that  includes elementary and high schools in Onanole, Erickson, Minnedosa, Rivers,  Forrest, Rapid City, Oak River, and Douglas. The priorities of the school  division are outlined as: mental health and wellbeing, cultural proficiency,  literacy and numeracy. In 2015 the school division mandated that the infusion  of aboriginal education into all schools was a top priority. &nbsp;This has come to fruition through additional  training for teachers and support staff, a requirement for all classes to have  at least one unit that focusses on Indigenous themes, and a database through  which teachers can share their curricula. While all schools in the division  have embraced this change, one school stands out: Erickson Collegiate Institute  (ECI). ECI is a high school located in the town of Erickson, Manitoba, but has  students attending from the surrounding towns of Onanole, Sandy Lake, and  Rolling River First Nation Reserve. The school has a population of  approximately 150 students from grades 7-12, with 45% of the population being  Aboriginal. In 2012 ECI began the long-term goal of incorporating Indigenous  perspectives into the curricula and extra-curricular activities, three years  before it was required by the division. The goals of ECI are to create a space  for education in which all students feel a sense of inclusion and where a better  understanding of the history of all Canadians can be reached while providing  role models for all students. It is important to the school that the infusion  of Indigenous knowledge is not seen as an event, but rather a sustainable  practice. </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside  of the classroom, this has included students participating in the Drag the Red  Project, Orange Shirt Day, organizing a multicultural day, attending  conferences, organizing a drumming group, and having the opportunity to smudge  at school and attend ceremonies and feasts. Within the classroom, each teacher  has taken a different approach to infusing Indigenous knowledge into the  curriculum. The Food and Nutrition course has guest chefs come in to teach the  students how to make different dishes from various cultures, including the  making of bannock and Indian Tacos. In the sciences the focus is on the  relationship with the natural world, studying plants and their uses, such as  suggested by Kulnieks, Longboat, and Young (2011). The Horticulture class has  an assignment on “the significance of wild rice crops to Indigenous people of  Manitoba” in which the presentation of the information can be written, oral, or  visual (Waterman 2017). In the fall of 2017, the photography class undertook a  project where they attended a traditional dance and photograph it. This  assignment provided the students, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, with the  opportunity to experience and better understand the ceremonies and ways of  knowing. It allowed the students to connect the land and histories with the  coursework in photography.   &nbsp;</div>
