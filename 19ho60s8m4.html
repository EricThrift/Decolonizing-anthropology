With a 1998 exhibition opening on the 1898 Cambridge expedition to the Torres Straight, the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology worked with cultural representatives from the Torres Strait in order to create a more complete and nuanced exhibition.          &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{herle1998}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaikie and Calum’s article,&nbsp;<i>Coproducing Efficacious Medicines</i>, details a collaborative ethnographic research event focusing on medicinal practitioners from India, Tibet, and Nepal. The event was set up as a workshop allowing these practitioners to explain and demonstrate their craft alongside anthropologists who had been working in these communities for decades. This article is a prime example of modern collaborative anthropology and illustrates one format in which this methodology may be implemented.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{al.2015}</cite></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;In    Pursuit of Connection: Reflections on Collaborative Work:</i> Kennedy reflects on her work in collaborative anthropology, drawing details from three projects; an ethnographic project in South America, and two collectively written books on feminist anthropology. She highlights both the difficulties posed by this methodology as well as what she felt was gained in the outcome of the research. Her third project in particular, the book&nbsp;<i>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold,&nbsp;</i>drew from work with the academic and lesbian communities and nicely illustrates the collaborative approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kennedy1995}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           In <i>Collaborative Anthropology as Twenty-first-Century Ethical Anthropology</i>, Fluehr-Lobban argues that collaborative anthropology is ethically preferable to other forms of research. She also argues for superior outcomes as this methodology draws on multiple perspectives, allowing for a more nuanced conclusion.

The passage&nbsp;<i>Introduction: the subject, method and scope of this inquiry</i> notes the beginnings of a shift in the perspective of anthropological research, and reestablishes the communities as the source of cultural authority.

Zarriga, et al. detail the process of community development and restoration in Papua New Guinea from the perspective of the Department of National Planning.
