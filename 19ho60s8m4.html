This work lead to a collection of ‘salvaged’ cultural information, interpreted and rewritten by Barbeau in order to return the material to its original and pure form, uninfluenced by neighbouring cultures (Barbeau, 1922). Barbeau’s belief that these rural french canadian cultures were facing imminent extinction was part of the push to preserve this cultural heritage, largely by establishing himself as the source of knowlege regarding genuine, “pure” culture (Barbeau, 1922).&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, Bronislaw Malinowski travelled to Papua, beginning his own ethnographic work under a very different—and perhaps more modern—methodology. Malinowski proposed a scientific protocol ensuring that the native point of view was articulated; he was one of the first in anthropological history to design his research format specifically to ensure this outcome (Malinowski 1922). His passage&nbsp;<i>Introduction: the subject, method and scope of this inquiry</i> notes the beginnings of a shift in the perspective of anthropological research—the reestablishment of the subject community as the source of cultural authority (1922). This was illustrated in Malinowski’s study of the Trobriand Islanders in New Guinea, which heavily impacted later anthropological work by furthering and encouraging the participant observation methodology(Malinowski 1922).     It was not a direct progression from Malinowski’s methodology to our current, more collaborative modern approach. As late as the nineteen-seventies, anthropological approaches devoid of any emic contribution—or even consideration—were still very popular, illustrated best with Marvin Harris’s work as a cultural materialist. However, these contrasting illustrations of early ethnographic research set the foundation for understanding the direction of the discipline, and its modern synthesis. Indeed, modern collaborative methods can trace their roots back to the introduction of participant observation and intensive fieldwork.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this essay, collaborative methodology in modern anthropology is explored as a methodological alternative to other research formats. Drawing inspiration from second-wave feminist anthropology and Canadian anthropology’s past advocacy work, this collaborative method developed only recently and still lacks a concrete methodological format. Indeed, any research structure focusing on collaboration can be defined as such.            Shared goals include a more nuanced and complete research outcome, the redefinition of ‘subjects’ as ‘participants’, and the erasure of damaging hierarchical research structures which act as legacies to our colonial history.</div><div>   </div>
