Smith's book&nbsp;<i>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{tuhiwai2013}</cite> is a well-known text that is not limited to anthropology, but that identifies different ways that research can be conducted by and with Indigenous peoples in ways that respect Indigenous needs and rights. </div><div>In a Canadian context, UBC anthropologist Charles Menzies has suggested a list of strategies for ethnographic research conducted "with, for, and among Indigenous peoples"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{menzies2001reflections}</cite>. </div><div>Central to both of these works is the premise that research must be truly collaborative from its inception, with research questions and priorities set in association with local communities, instead of operating in an extractive or merely consultative mode. Identifying Indigenous communities as partners and collaborators (e.g.,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{ridington2013happiness}</cite>) implies a substantially different relationship between anthropologists and collaborators than is suggested for conventional participant observation, in which the ethnographer is a privileged subject whose role is to understand, and report on, "the natives"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{malinowski2002argonauts}</cite>.</div><h1 data-label="502040" class="ltx_title_section">Etc.Decolonization Through Autoethnography</h1><div>Julie Cruikshank's book&nbsp;<i>Life Lived Like a Story</i>&nbsp;presents the stories of three individual women in their own words.

With a 1998 exhibition opening on the 1898 Cambridge expedition to the Torres Straight, the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology worked with cultural representatives from the Torres Strait in order to create a more complete and nuanced exhibition.          &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{herle1998}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaikie and Calum’s article,&nbsp;<i>Coproducing Efficacious Medicines</i>, details a collaborative ethnographic research event focusing on medicinal practitioners from India, Tibet, and Nepal. The event was set up as a workshop allowing these practitioners to explain and demonstrate their craft alongside anthropologists who had been working in these communities for decades. This article is a prime example of modern collaborative anthropology and illustrates one format in which this methodology may be implemented.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{al.2015}</cite></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;In    Pursuit of Connection: Reflections on Collaborative Work:</i> Kennedy reflects on her work in collaborative anthropology, drawing details from three projects; an ethnographic project in South America, and two collectively written books on feminist anthropology. She highlights both the difficulties posed by this methodology as well as what she felt was gained in the outcome of the research. Her third project in particular, the book&nbsp;<i>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold,&nbsp;</i>drew from work with the academic and lesbian communities and nicely illustrates the collaborative approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{kennedy1995}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           In <i>Collaborative Anthropology as Twenty-first-Century Ethical Anthropology</i>, Fluehr-Lobban argues that collaborative anthropology is ethically preferable to other forms of research. She also argues for superior outcomes as this methodology draws on multiple perspectives, allowing for a more nuanced conclusion. Fluehr-Lobban contrasts collaborative anthropology with perviously used Boasnian models, European social anthropology, and colonial influences.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{c2008}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           Lassiter explores the history and development of collaborative ethnographies in <i>Collaborative Ethnography and Public Anthropology</i>, creating a context for contemporary collaborative research. Historical themes influencing this development include feminist anthropology and postmodernist approaches. Lassiter argues for the use of collaborative research in modern work as a way to more immediately serve the subject communities.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{e2005}</cite></div><div>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<i>Moving Past Anthropology and doing Collaborative Research</i>, Lassiter introduces the current debates surrounding collaborative anthropology, and suggests methods for future collaborative work. While Lassiter focuses heavily on the criticisms of this methodology, he does encourage the use and development of collaborative research in the anthropological sphere.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{e.2008}</cite></div><div>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malinowski proposes a scientific protocol ensuring that the native point of view is articulated; he is one of the first in anthropological history to set methodology specifically ensuring this outcome. The passage&nbsp;<i>Introduction: the subject, method and scope of this inquiry</i> notes the beginnings of a shift in the perspective of anthropological research, and reestablishes the communities as the source of cultural authority. This is illustrated in Malinowski’s study of the Trobriand Islanders in New Guinea.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{b1922}</cite></div><div>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret Rodman’s project <i>Working Together in Vanuatu: Research Histories, Collaborations, Projects and Reflections</i>, culminating in a published book, drew on research gathered in a workshop in Vanuatu, in the Pacific Islands. The book was a collection of reports written during this workshop and included not only the work of three anthropologists but the reports of eleven field-workers and ten house-girls. This research highlighted the girl’s experiences with their employers and explored the themes of gender and race in Vanuatu.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           Tylor details the scientific approach to ethnographical research in Primitive Culture. He provides insight into early anthropological methods and reasoning prior to the rise of collaborative work, illustrating the methodological basis that collaborative methodology was eventually introduced to. Tylor also expands on cultural evolution and cultural laws, though these are not as pertinent to the essay.</div><div>           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruby Zarriga’s article, <i>Restorative Justice in Papua New Guinea: a Collaborative Effort,</i> provides another illustration of a modern and practical application of collaborative anthropology. Zarriga, et al. detail the process of community development and restoration in Papua New Guinea from the perspective of the Department of National Planning. Collaborative methods are emphasized, with multiple perspectives lending to decision making, and the communities themselves are pulled into this process in order to create change that genuinely improves their lives.&nbsp;</div><div>   </div>
