Smith's book&nbsp;<i>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{tuhiwai2013}</cite> is a well-known text that is not limited to anthropology, but that identifies different ways that research can be conducted by and with Indigenous peoples in ways that respect Indigenous needs and rights. </div><div>In a Canadian context, UBC anthropologist Charles Menzies has suggested a list of strategies for ethnographic research conducted "with, for, and among Indigenous peoples"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{menzies2001reflections}</cite>. </div><div>Central to both of these works is the premise that research must be truly collaborative from its inception, with research questions and priorities set in association with local communities, instead of operating in an extractive or merely consultative mode. Identifying Indigenous communities as partners and collaborators (e.g.,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{ridington2013happiness}</cite>) implies a substantially different relationship between anthropologists and collaborators than is suggested for conventional participant observation, in which the ethnographer is a privileged subject whose role is to understand, and report on, "the natives"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{malinowski2002argonauts}</cite>.</div><h1 data-label="502040" class="ltx_title_section">Etc.Decolonization Through Autoethnography</h1><div>Julie Cruikshank's book&nbsp;<i>Life Lived Like a Story</i>&nbsp;presents the stories of three individual women in their own words. This allows for the native telling of their stories, allowing for ethnography that was not filtered through a third party who's biases might effect the intended meaning of these stories&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{cruikshank1990}</cite>.</div><div>In this article Hughes, Pennington and Makris challenge the idea that autoethnography is not academic. This is confronted through looking at publishing statistics.

Murphy's "The Body Silent" is an insider autoethnography. Murphy, an anthropologist, documents his transition into becoming a member of the disabled community.

Through his sculptures, Bill Reid's material autoethnography brought an indigenous perspective of&nbsp; Haida culture to the spotlight.

With a 1998 exhibition opening on the 1898 Cambridge expedition to the Torres Straight, the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology worked with cultural representatives from the Torres Strait in order to create a more complete and nuanced exhibition.           </div><div>Blaikie and Calum’s article, <i>Coproducing Efficacious Medicines</i>, details a collaborative ethnographic research event focusing on medicinal practitioners from India, Tibet, and Nepal. The event was set up as a workshop allowing these practitioners to explain and demonstrate their craft alongside anthropologists who had been working in these communities for decades. This article is a prime example of modern collaborative anthropology and illustrates one format in which this methodology may be implemented.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;In    Pursuit of Connection: Reflections on Collaborative Work:</i> Kennedy reflects on her work in collaborative anthropology, drawing details from three projects; an ethnographic project in South America, and two collectively written books on feminist anthropology. She highlights both the difficulties posed by this methodology as well as what she felt was gained in the outcome of the research. Her third project in particular, the book&nbsp;<i>Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold,&nbsp;</i>drew from work with the academic and lesbian communities and nicely illustrates the collaborative approach.</div><div>   </div>
