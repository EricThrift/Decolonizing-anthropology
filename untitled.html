New York: Associated Educational Services, 1969.</b></div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyon and  Friesen’s book explores the broad framework of the cultural changes that took  place in Southern Alberta in relation to Aboriginal culture, evaluating how  these changes were perceived and understood.&nbsp;  They look more closely at how this impacted education and conversely how  education impacted the understanding of the changes taking place. I will also  use this book as a comparison for the changes that are currently taking place  within the education system regarding decolonization and how anthropology has  played a role in this.</div><div><span><b>Fisher, A.

Fisher looks at the specific stages each  has gone through and how they have each influenced education. As well, Fisher  discusses residential schools and the role anthropology played in the  introduction and the abolishment of the schools.&nbsp; To decolonize Canadian anthropology, we must  be able to accept and understand the negative aspects of the discipline in its  early years. This article will help to demonstrate how anthropology and  education have evolved together.</div><div>    <b>Macias, Jose. 1996. “Racial and Ethnic Exclusion: A Problem  for Anthropology and Education.”&nbsp;</b><i><b>Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly</b></i><b>&nbsp;27  (2): 141–50.</b></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macias  discusses the reaction of educational anthropologists to the 1994 referendum in  California regarding the education of the children of illegal immigrants. He  examines how the rise in xenophobia, racism, ethnic cleansings, and antisemitism  are affecting children’s right to education. Macias argues that anthropologists  should be studying the patterns of ethnic exclusion and publicly advocating  against it. Again, this demonstrates anthropologists’ role in education.</div><div>    <b>Munroe, Elizabeth Ann, Lisa Lunney-Borden, Anne Murray-Orr,  Denise Toney, and Jane Meader. 2013. “Decolonizing Aboriginal Education in the  21st Century.”&nbsp;</b><i><b>Mcgill Journal of Education</b></i><b>&nbsp;48 (2): 317–37.</b></div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this  article, the authors discuss Indigenous ways of knowing and the learning  movement of the 21st century. They combine the two systems of  knowledge to put forth recommendations for the decolonizing of Aboriginal  education. The authors are of Indigenous heritage and use this background as  well as their education to provide an anthropological analysis. This article is  an excellent example of how decolonizing Canadian anthropology can influence  and be influenced by education its decolonization.</div><div>    <b>Aikenhead, Glen S, and Dean Elliott. 2010. “An Emerging  Decolonizing Science Education in Canada.”&nbsp;</b><i><b>Canadian Journal of Science,  Mathematics and Technology Education</b></i><b>10 (4): 321–38.  doi:10.1080/14926156.2010.524967.</b></div><div>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus  of this article is how Indigenous knowledge has been incorporated into the science  curriculum in Saskatchewan, promoting the decolonization of Canadian education.  The research for the construction was undertaken in collaboration with  Indigenous communities and textbook publishers. While this article does not  directly involve anthropologists, the ideas behind the article and the  incorporation of traditional teachings into science can also be used in other  subject areas, and provide examples of Indigenous communities being involved in  the collection and dissemination of knowledge.</div><div>    <b>Mills, David, Missy Morton, and British Educational Research  Association. 2013.&nbsp;</b><i><b>Ethnography in Education</b></i><b>. Research Methods in  Education. Los Angeles: SAGE.</b></div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book  by Mills and Morton discusses the different methods used to create  ethnographies and how to incorporate ethnographic research into education. Mills  and Morton thoroughly explore how to write engaging ethnographies for audiences  other than academics. They also discuss the relationship between political  agendas, such as decolonization, and scholarly research. The advice given in  this book is an excellent example of how fieldwork can be conducted within  Canada and how that information can be used in public education.&nbsp;</div><div>    <b>WANE, NJOKI NATHANI. 2009. “Indigenous Education and  Cultural Resistance: A Decolonizing Project.”&nbsp;</b><i><b>Curriculum Inquiry</b></i><b>&nbsp;39  (1): 159–78. doi:10.1111/j.1467-873X.2008.01443.x.</b></div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this article  Wane discusses different schools on curriculum construction and how many  different voices need to be heard in the process.&nbsp; As well, Wane explores several different  educational reforms that have taken place over the last several decades and  have played a role in the decolonization of education. Wane also looks at what  decolonization is and how it can take place. This portion of the article  provides examples of the decolonization process that can be implemented into  anthropological study.&nbsp;</div><div>            </div>
