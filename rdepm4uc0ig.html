<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With relations being important for archaeologists and  museums to understand repatriation is a clear point to have when dealing with  legalities of ownership. This after all, improves your exhibits and which  improves the records that are being kept. This means updating or change of the  archaeological ethics code in countries that have Indigenous peoples within  their national borders. Relations with Indigenous groups may be different from  group to group like in the Arctic. Searles says that he did not encounter the  same problems that others were having due to the “<b>Kennewick man</b>” in the 1996. In the Canadian Arctic, Searles when he graduated in 1989 he was hired by the National museum of Natural History to catalog the Arctic artifacts that were in their collection. Then afterwards he was hired on to join the expedition up north as well where a member from the Inuit community joined them to help them with navigation and logistical purposes in the waters of Labrador and southern Baffin island&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Searles2017}</cite>. This hiring of the Inuit, called Pauloosie, was an important member of their team to help make sure they survived the waters. These relationships that Searles explains from his own personal experiences shows that the community and inclusiveness of archaeology can be a beneficial tool to avoid conflicts with communities like that of what was happening with the Kennewick man when he was first discovered.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Relations with the Inuit were important to keep in good relations with since they knew the land. This knowledge of the land has been exploited by the governments and colonial powers but now in recently things have been on the change. Again Searles, draws the attention to the need for inclusion to the indigenous community to help spark the desire for the indigenous communities to preserve the remains found. In these respects of preservation it is up to the community to preserve them artifacts the way they believe is the best way for them. The desire for the wanting archaeologists in the community - whether they are non-indigenous or are indigenous - the needing for the spark of archaeology is needed to help with these remains and artifacts that may be found. Searles advocates the need for more indigenous people in the field of archaeology to ensure the proper preservation of the found remains and artifacts and the inclusion is required for this. This inclusion will be needed to avoid problems here in Canada and America with the indigenous communities.</div><div>    </div><h2>Archaeological reforms of Canada and America.</h2><div>    </div><div>                    </div><div>When discussing the reforms in archaeology, one must consider the change of ethics.&nbsp; This change helped Indigenous groups in having a voice, especially during the involvement of archaeological sites.&nbsp; Organizations such as the CAA (Canadian Archaeological Association), the SAA (Society for American Archaeology), and other groups have helped in defining guidelines for archaeologists in working with Indigenous communities (.</div><div>      </div>
