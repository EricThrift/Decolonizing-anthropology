<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With relations being important for archaeologists and  museums to understand repatriation is a clear point to have when dealing with  legalities of ownership. This after all, improves your exhibits and which  improves the records that are being kept. This means updating or change of the  archaeological ethics code in countries that have Indigenous peoples within  their national borders. Relations with Indigenous groups may be different from  group to group like in the Arctic. Searles says that he did not encounter the  same problems that others were having due to the “<b>Kennewick man</b>” in the 1996. In the Canadian Arctic, Searles when he graduated in 1989 he was hired by the National museum of Natural History to catalog the Arctic artifacts that were in their collection. Then afterwards he was hired on to join the expedition up north as well where a member from the Inuit community joined them to help them with navigation and logistical purposes in the waters of Labrador and southern Baffin island&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Searles2017}</cite>. This hiring of the Inuit, called Pauloosie, was an important member of their team to help make sure they survived the waters. These relationships that Searles explains from his own personal experiences shows that the community and inclusiveness of archaeology can be a beneficial tool to avoid conflicts with communities like that of what was happening with the Kennewick man when he was first discovered.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Relations with the Inuit were important to keep in good relations with since they knew the land. This knowledge of the land has been exploited by the governments and colonial powers but now in recently things have been on the change. Again Searles, draws the attention to the need for inclusion to the indigenous community to help spark the desire for the indigenous communities to preserve the remains found. In these respects of preservation it is up to the community to preserve them artifacts the way they believe is the best way for them. The desire for the wanting archaeologists in the community - whether they are non-indigenous or are indigenous - the needing for the spark of archaeology is needed to help with these remains and artifacts that may be found. Searles advocates the need for more indigenous people in the field of archaeology to ensure the proper preservation of the found remains and artifacts and the inclusion is required for this. This inclusion will be needed to avoid problems here in Canada and America with the indigenous communities.</div><div>    </div><h2>Archaeological reforms of Canada and America.</h2><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking of reforms in archaeology it is more to do  with the change ethics. This change in the ethics of allowed for more of a  voice to be given to the Indigenous groups that may and are involved with the  archaeological sites. Organizations such as CAA here in Canada, the SAA in  America and other organizations have helped to define guidelines for  archaeologists about Indigenous communities. It is a crucial step that was  taken by archaeologist in the 1990’s to include the Indigenous people since  they are still a living culture. The first conference of archaeologists was a  global one and was the first code of ethics to be created that included  Indigenous people&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. While <b>SOPA</b> or  Society of Professional Archaeologists created a code of ethics that help to  support the archaeologist within a legal measure <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. These conferences and societies were  important to help push archaeology into the modern era.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeology has been based within a colonial framework.  Removal of artifacts and items to be displayed within museums for the public to  see and to promote nationality and depending on where you are in the world,  modernity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>. When speaking of  modernity, it is an idea that a government wants to be like that of the West or  where ever they see as modern. In Indonesia, museums were built as a display of  modernism and nationalism but depending on where you were the museums felt  distant from the public <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>.  Museums themselves -viewed personally – are constructs of the past colonial  structure and which confines the archaeological evidence within it. What is  needed is the following of what some museums in Indonesia have done and hiring  local people of the tribe that the museum focuses on which helps to strengthen  the relationship of the institute and allow for more authentic exhibits to be  performed <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These go along with the idea of inclusion of Indigenous  people in-line with the creation of the codes of ethics by the archaeological  society and groups. The study that was conducted though by Rosenswig (1997)  shows that the reforms showed clear cut how each society focused on the  Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This means that in the ethical actions of  archaeologists who may work for museums and universities have protection to  make sure that all parties are equally represented. With SOPA’s code of ethics  the archaeologist must follow guidelines or will be discredited and also for  the WAC code of ethics it highly encouraged the employment of indigenous people  in the field. These code of ethics from former colonies as well helped to protect  themselves and the archaeologist within legal framework because the Indigenous  people were given a voice and an equal share&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. The codes also differed from country  to country and Canada was the only nation to use “spirit” within the CAA code  of ethics while in America the SAA was for the mercantile and preservation of Indigenous  artifacts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with some of these changes happening in the 1990’s it  is still relevant to acknowledge the changes that took place. These changes  helped to give more of a voice to the Indigenous people on what artifacts would  be displayed by museums and collected by archaeologists. Another is the change  in the way the world was viewing the Indigenous people. The view that everyone  had has now become a more protective society of it and that the importance of  their culture must be there to preserve the Indigenous autonomy when it comes  to living cultures artifacts. This legal framework also helped to build a  better relationship with the nations own Indigenous people and gave also the  nation their own guidelines to control how artifacts should be treated within  national borders.</div><div>    </div><h2>Reflection to changes in museums and archaeology.</h2><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude this section, it is evident   to myself that there is still much work needing to be done. Canada and America   both need to be willing to relinquish the items – not artifacts since   artifacts mean material remains of a past and not living culture – for the   ownership of such items belongs to that of the Indigenous community. It is   understandable that both parties do want to keep the items and have good   claims but truly the items deserve to be with their proper owners. These items   have more important symbolism than we can understand and deserve to be with   people that understand them. Though this paper is not here to state that “this   is the way we need to correct these problems,” it is here to shed more light   on the subject. As advocates this is what needs to be done to ensure the   continued trust and support of Indigenous communities which is highlighted in   Searles’s article. We as the advocates for the Indigenous community it is   relevant to bring to light the changes that need to be done in not just   archaeology but in anthropology, as well.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeology has significant role to help people from all  ethnics to be proud of their past cultures and same too does anthropology have  to that of present cultures. It is important to note that museums play a big  part in constructing a national identity. This national identity helps to  de-construct the colonialism of the nation but also replaces it with a  commodifying effect on the country. What is important is the education of  people, both Indigenous and non-indigenous, for that is a start de-construct  this cycle of colonialism. In the start of Donald’s article, he gives a story  about how he went to a fort in Edmonton, Alberta and at this fort he realized  the myth construct of the fort and the wilderness; the civilized and the  primitive. The educational system needs to be this reforming and informational  part to help separate the colonialism that has gripped our country and that of  others&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Donald2009}</cite>. It is evident that  even sharing our message from here in Canada to that of other places of the  world is important since not all nations have this ethics code to share. It  needs to be there to help improve the lives of all Indigenous people, but it  will show problems too like in South Africa with the Boers <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that de-colonialization of Canadian anthropology  is best to be confronted by advocacy and education is going to be the best  practical options. Here in Canada, we need to be the advocates of this change  and be at the frontlines to protect Indigenous items from the environment and  ourselves. This model of taking or looting as they would see it needs to be changed  to end this colonial cycle and in-turn means the need of a new model. When  Plaice went to South Africa and explained their thesis to South African  anthropologists it sent a ripple that surprised them since they were dealing  with a unique type of Indigeneity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>. This form of  Indigeneity was about the Boers and how they claimed to be Indigenous to South  Africa, yet they were descendants of Dutch colonialists <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>. This posed a problem where the  Indigenous majority where surprised to see a small group having such power over  a government&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>.</div><div>     &nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="467459" class="ltx_title_section"><b>The Decolonization of Archaeological Practices</b>&nbsp;</h1><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Archaeology has always been a colonialist endeavour where archaeologists have considered themselves experts on the Indigenous past.&nbsp; Although there is a growing recognition among western scholars of the value of Indigenous knowledge, scientific research still remains a prominent source of validation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{harris2005}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
