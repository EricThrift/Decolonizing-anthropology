As a  branch of applied anthropology, educational anthropologists produce  ethnographies in which they study the culture of schools, often in order to  help with the formulation of curricula and aiding educators in solving  classroom problems. Anthropological tools, such as  ethnography, have also  been adopted by researchers outside of the field of anthropology in order to  understand the impact of and develop curricula. Current trends in curricula  development focus on the decolonization of the classroom through the  incorporation of Indigenous ways of knowing, such as the Medicine Wheel  teachings and a focus on the relationship between people and their place, and  an emphasis on eco-civic responsibilities. Rolling River School Division, and  in particular Erickson Collegiate Institute, are prime examples of how various  Indigenous perspectives have been incorporated into the classroom with the aid  of anthropological tools and methods. An examination of the history of  educational anthropology and its colonial roots, current developments and  trends in curricula development, and an in-depth case study of Rolling River  School Division and Erickson Collegiate will demonstrate the ways in which anthropologists  play a key role in decolonizing not only anthropology but also education. The  cooperation between anthropologists and educators in studying the impacts of and  developing decolonizing curricula through the incorporation of Indigenous  Knowledge and anthropological tools will provide a holistic understanding of  the Canadian education system and the ways in which can be improved in order to  provide all students with an education that will prepare them for all aspects  of life in Canada.&nbsp;</div>
