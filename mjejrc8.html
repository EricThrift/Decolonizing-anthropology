<div></div><div>As this paper will be discussing the legal actions that have  been taken against Western museums and what legal and ethical actions have been  done within the anthropology community itself.    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section will also be considering the archaeological side  of anthropology. Meaning it will have more information from a federal aspect to it and possibly to deconstruct the <b>colonialism</b> in archaeology.  With archaeology being closely attached to the colonialism it is important to  separate this. Throughout this paper it will be one of the goals to help  separate that side of the archaeology to move forward. Canada and America both  have done great reforms to the field and treatment of Indigenous people but  there is always more needing to be done. I believe that within this paper it  will be affirmed that archaeology, even though working with governments, must  be the advocates of both living and past cultures.  &nbsp;</div><div>                    </div><div></div><div>  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>      </div>
