<div> </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian anthropologists were not the only ones influenced by colonial techniques, as similar methodologies were employed in the United States. American anthropologist Julian Steward maintained a close relationship with the American Federal government and the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) with respect to its treatment of American Indigenous peoples. Steward is viewed as one of the proponents of the creation of American anthropology and founded the theory ‘cultural ecology’ but his contribution to colonial practices in the discipline are often overlooked. The Department of Justice created the ICC in order to address Indigenous claims and contracted anthropologists such as Julian Steward to provide testimonies on these Indigenous groups and their land claims. “In its defence for the Paiute cases, the U.S. Department of Justice relied entirely on Steward’s reports on the Shoshone to assert that “the government was not liable for any claims because the petitioners did not hold original Indian title” (Stewart 1959: 51; Ronaasen et al. 1999).” (Pinkoski 2008: 191) Steward used his anthropological work to reinforce colonial ideologies and assist the American government in dealing with the ‘Indian problem’.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>	The romanticism of the anthropologist setting out to study the ‘primitive’ Indigenous group in the late 19th century can be seen as an influence of colonialism in Canadian anthropology. Figure 2 above from Erickson and Murphy encapsulate this image of t This idea of the&nbsp;<b>noble savage</b> is a theme that dominates the anthropological writings of the time. Franz Boas in his work on the Inuit on Baffin Island from 1883-1884 presents this viewpoint in his compiled letters. Boas writes, “I am now truly just like a typical Eskimo.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{al1998}</cite> (Boas 1998: 15) Boas studied the Inuit and used&nbsp;<b>participant observation</b> techniques but there was a distance kept between himself as the researcher and the Inuit, as the subject matter. When Boas states that he is "like a typical Eskimo" he implies that he has a full understanding of their culture, which is contradicted by his method which distanced him from the Inuit people. This example highlights how early anthropologists perspectives were often generalizing and colonial (<b>Kevin. I added these sentences to elaborate on the example</b>).</div><div> </div><div>	Work on Indigenous groups in Canada differed from its American counterparts in material culture was a more immediate concern to American anthropologists. Cory Willmott argues Canadian anthropology employed a colonial model to its methodologies, whereas American anthropology leaned towards a more nationalist model. Colonialism dominated the beginnings of Canadian anthropology and a focus on solely material culture. “Canadian anthropologists argued that because of limited funds that were available for research, it was more important to record the vanishing customs of living Indian peoples than to excavate their prehistoric remains.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{trigger1984}</cite> (Trigger, 1984: 361). As Canada is still very much a British colonial colony, these deep ties are still present in the society and how anthropology is conducted. Many of the founders of Canadian anthropology were British or from outside of Canada and were influenced by colonial ideologies that shaped the discipline. The emergence of anthropology itself was rooted in the beginnings of wealthy European men setting out to explore and document the ‘primitive’ minorities of the world.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>	Canadian anthropology has gone through a number of changes over the past two centuries in its practices, methodologies and ethical standards for conducting fieldwork. Anthropologists in Canada are increasingly held to higher standards when studying minority groups, specifically Indigenous groups in Canada. The colonial history and nature of the discipline has greatly affected the relationship between the anthropologist and subject in Indigenous studies.&nbsp;<b>Applied anthropology</b> has emerged as a growing discipline in Canadian anthropology and focuses on Indigenous peoples. “These earlier, often overtly (if not always overly) political readings of the roles of anthropologists during the colonial era have also helped to perpetuate the long-standing practice within the discipline of relegating the study of development to a much maligned subfield of applied anthropology.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{paiement2007}</cite> (Paiement 2007: 199). A large majority of Indigenous groups use oral techniques that previous Canadian anthropology scholarship ignored in favour of material culture. “Increasingly aboriginal people have their own ideas about the kind of relationship they want to establish with an anthropologist.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{waldram2014}</cite> (Dyck and Waldram. 2014: 136). Previously, Indigenous groups were in an unequal power relationship with anthropologist in they were merely the subjects and had no active role in the ethnography. Anthropologists have increasingly been working in collaborative efforts with their subjects to create a balanced relationship in a more collaborative effort.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>	Canadian anthropology has struggled with finding its identity and rectifying its colonial past. Since colonialism is such a large part of Canadian history, it would be impossible for anthropologists to ignore the past. Audra Simpson argues that “the work of understanding these issues of membership, political recognition, sovereignty and autonomy within communities requires an historical sensibility (and reckoning) that is deeply horizontal as well as vertical.” (Simpson 2007: 76). Anthropology across the world has struggled with its colonial beginnings throughout the past centuries. Canadian anthropology especially has a tense nature with its colonial beginnings as the country has struggled with its treatment of Indigenous people across disciplines. “The limited impact of accumulated anthropological knowledge on the often grim lives of Canadian Native people, and on policy development, has been a recurrent source of reflection for anthropologists, suggesting at the very least, disquiet at the inability of the discipline to play a clear and constructive role in these arenas.” (Harrison and Darnell 2014: 9). Canadian anthropologists previously ignored some of the growing issues affecting Indigenous society, but in the last few decades has become an emerging topic at the forefront of the discipline.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>	Anthropologists in Canada have now begun to take a more active role in their relationship with Indigenous groups and understand their influence in shaping policy-making. They are able to express a unique viewpoint in that they are able to collaborate with both minority groups and policy makers. Anthropologists in Canada are able to present these previously unheard groups to a larger audience. This active role of the anthropologist is as an agent in helping to shape policy reform. Newer fields in anthropology have emerged as responses to the colonial history of the origins of the discipline. “Although not unique to Canada, Canadian anthropologists are making noticeable contributions to the anthropology of advocacy and participatory or action-styled research.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{holyoak2006}</cite> (Ervin and Holyoak 2006: 142). Canadian anthropologists have become advocates for Indigenous groups on societal issues such as land claims, health initiates and quality of life. Anthropologists as whistleblowers have become a way to shift away from its colonial past. Canadian anthologist Dara Speck in the late 1980’s used her position to lobby for improved conditions of minority groups. “In this passionate ethnography, she expands on the tragic and unnecessary death of a young Kwakiutl girl to appendicitis and medical malpractice.” (Ervin and Holyoak 2006: 142) Rather than using their position to help governments abuse minority groups, Canadian anthropologists have taken an active role in providing a platform for these groups to be visible and heard.</div><div> </div><div>	Indigenous groups in Canada are also becoming active participants in the ways anthropology is conducted in their communities. “They emphasize the participatory component of fieldwork, suggesting that ethnographers who want to work in their communities should be prepared to do so in ways and during times specified by the community.” (Dyck et al. 2014: 136). Proper ethical consent and representation have become a focal point of anthropological work in Canada regarding Indigenous groups. Ethnography with Indigenous groups has become more of a collaborative effort between the two parties rather than previous methods with a lack of openness on the part of the anthropologist. Previously, the anthropologist would enter the community, complete their observations and leave to write their report on the fieldwork collected. Now, those participants have taken a more equal standpoint in how ethnology and fieldwork is representing their community. “A number of First Nations and Aboriginal students have completed undergraduate and graduate programs in anthropology in recent years, and many of them have opted to study and write about issues pertaining to Indigenous peoples.” (Dyck 2014: 89) Post-colonial methodologies in anthropology have allowed for more collaborative efforts such as interpretive and feminist anthropology.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>	<b>(**POSSIBLY DELETE**)</b>Frequently in anthropology, minorities and Indigenous groups are left out in having an active role in fieldwork. With changing societal norms and the emergence of Indigenous studies in anthropology, these previously unheard groups now have a voice. Research and ethical management surrounding how anthropologist’s have conducted their work in Canada has increasingly changed and adapted over the last few decades. Noel Dyck in his article, “Cultures, Communities and Claims: Anthropology and Native Studies in Canada” discusses how “the nature of anthropologists’ involvement with aboriginal communities and issues has been shifting as field researchers have been asked to intervene on behalf of native peoples when dealing governments.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dyck1990}</cite> (Dyck 1990: 43). Audra Simpson is an individual who presents an interesting viewpoint of Canadian anthropology throughout her writing. She is an anthropologist and an Canadian Indigenous woman who is able to be part of both so-called ‘worlds’. Simpson has written extensively on her work as an anthropologist and how her Indigenous background has influenced how she conducts and perceives the discipline.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>	With the introduction of post-colonial methodologies, anthropological theory has gone through a number of changes. Post-modernism, feminist and gendered theory, and interpretive anthropology have all become theories created as a reaction to this previous colonial influence. Previously, colonial anthropology disregarded the roles of women and other ‘unseen’ minorities in anthropological studies. “In turn, they focus on the necessity for generating a method of disciplinary self-reflection; and, consistently, they offer this need for a new method as a means to acknowledge and level power imbalances between ethnographers and subjects so as to improve the basic anthropological project.” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{pinkoski2008}</cite>(Pinkoski 2008: 174). Anthropologists are currently reviewing the colonial past of anthropology and finding new methodologies to end this colonial influence. “To overcome the unequal social relations embedded in the methods of anthropology, these authors advocated for greater self-reflexive techniques within the discipline’s methodology.” (Pinkoski 2008: 174)</div><div></div><div>	In conclusion, colonialism and its influence on anthropology remains a tense issue across the world, especially in Canada with its ever present effects. Prior to the professionalization era of anthropology, missionaries conducted the majority of anthropological work in Canada who were heavily influenced by colonialist attitudes and methods. With the work of individuals such as Franz Boas, Lewis Henry Morgan and Marius Barbeau, detailed and extensive fieldwork methodologies and participant observation became the standard for anthropological work in Canada. Still influenced by their own Eurocentric biases, the unequal relationship between the anthropologist and Indigenous groups continued. As responses and re-evaluations in the discipline have emerged in the last few decades, anthropologists have sought to rectify these colonial influences. Indigenous groups, the subject of fieldwork have become active agents in these studies and taken a more equal role alongside the anthropologist to create a collaborative work.</div><div> </div><div>Bibliography</div><div>Boas, Franz, et al.&nbsp;<i>Franz Boas among the Inuit of Baffin Island, 1883-1884 : Journals and Letters</i>.
