<div>                      </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthropological research as a whole has helped extensively in producing massive collections for museums to help answer questions of our past.&nbsp; The implications on how they were acquired and their interpretations, however, have raised concern over the recent years.&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contemporary research standards and ethical codes require researchers to seek the consent of those they study and inform them of the benefits and risks due to their research.&nbsp; Many agencies and universities that fund research have set parameters such as institutional review boards to assure that this procedure happens.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even with all these ethical parameters in place, informed consent can be  real problematic in descendant communities.&nbsp; There may be those within traditional communities who cannot read the documentation, or may not completely understand the implications of archaeological research&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{zimmerman2005}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Misinterpretations of archaeological contexts are also extremely problematic and can cause lasting harm to their descendants.&nbsp; An example of this is the Crow Creek site that contained the remains of nearly 500 victims from the fourteenth century.&nbsp; The remains belonged to a culture known to be ancestral to the Arikara nation.&nbsp; They were located on federal property within the Crow Creek Reservation, inhabited by the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota Sioux, who were the traditional enemies of the Arikara. &nbsp;When news of the discovery was made public, the Sioux immediately claimed responsibility towards the massacre.&nbsp; As osteological evidence began to show signs of mutilation, including scalping, the Dakota Sioux backed away from their claim in perpetuating the attack.&nbsp; As scientists, archaeologists tend to view context from an&nbsp;<b>etic</b> perspective and forget the implications behind their assessments.&nbsp; In the case of the Crow Creek massacre, the discovery of the mutilations and scalping resurfaced social stereotypes of Indigenous peoples as savages.&nbsp; Another example can be found in the state of Iowa, where an osteologist reported to a statewide newspaper that he found evidence of syphilis on the remains of a prehistoric burial mound.&nbsp; Since syphilis is a difficult disease to assess visually, it can be easily misdiagnosed from other diseases.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his announcement caused quite a stir and left a damaging impression on the female Indigenous population &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{zimmerman2005}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>                          </div><div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Repatriation</b> has been a contentious issue amongst archaeologists and Indigenous peoples over the years.&nbsp; We can see this development within the popular case of the&nbsp;<b>Kennewick</b>&nbsp;<b>Man</b>. &nbsp;The Kennewick Man was discovered on July 28th 1996 by two young men who accidentally stepped on a skull while trying to sneak into a boat race event in Kennewick, Washington.&nbsp; The skull was taken by a coroner and analyzed by an archaeological consultant by the name of James Chatters.&nbsp; After retrieving the rest of the remains from the site, Chatters decided to submit a hand bone for radiocarbon dating without the consultation of the federal or tribal authorities.&nbsp; When the date came back as 8,700 BP, the federal agency took possession of the remains and invoked the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (<b>NAGPRA</b>).&nbsp; The agency determined that the remains pertained to five tribes and approved its repatriation.&nbsp; This did not bode well with the scientists.&nbsp; They immediately mounted a large professional and public relations campaign to halt the repatriation process.&nbsp; When these efforts failed, eight of the most prominent professionals sued the agency in federal court for the right to study the remains before they were repatriated.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions are a great example of the divide between the scientific community and the Indigenous community.&nbsp; The scientists believed that NAGPRA had failed since the remains were never confirmed ‘scientifically’ as Indigenous.&nbsp; They also felt that they were stripped of important findings that would help piece together details of the New World.&nbsp; The Indigenous peoples’ views differed; NAGPRA helped them to have access in reclaiming the remains and to prevent the further study and desecration of the bones&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{longenecker2005}</cite>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, great strides are being made to improve relations between archaeologists and Indigenous communities.&nbsp; Since the late 1980s, the involvement of Indigenous communities within archaeology has increased steadily and significantly.&nbsp; We now see archaeologists actively working with Indigenous populations in the pursuit of land claims or to challenge land developments.&nbsp; There has also been an increase in the pursuit of post-secondary education, enabling Indigenous students to contribute towards archaeological research&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/80989/articles/200071-decolonizing-anthropology#nicholas2006">(Nicholas 2006)</a>.&nbsp; This inclusion of an Indigenous perspective not only helps to&nbsp;<b>decolonize</b> archaeology but promotes a truly&nbsp;<b>holistic</b> approach within the field.</div><div>      </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;
