Museums and anthropology have  worked together to provide a glimpse into the cultures of the world. The way  they have done this is by artifacts. Artifacts normally are remnants of past  cultures that have died out over the centuries. Thanks to these artifacts we  are given a better understanding of how life may have been for them, since most  artifacts are within scientific certainty of the archaeologists’ perspective.  Though the artifacts in question here would be that of a past civilization but  what about a living culture? Does it not mean that living cultures ‘artifacts’  are actually important ritual items or maybe something more? Why does  anthropology support these tendencies to remove these artifacts from a  community that view such things as sacred? </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of anthropology and even during the time  of antiquity collection of past cultures artifacts was a sign of heritage. This  heritage that an individual would display would play to their advantage to help  push forward their claim to something that is greater. For newly formed nations  such as America, Canada and the other parts of the America’s this clinging onto  need to have a strong national identity like that of their colonial parent. The  difference between the colony and the parent nation is that of living people  being there and already having an identity. What is needing to be noted is how  the new colonies viewed the living people there already. What is evident is the  need for more legal representation of Indigenous groups in the Americas and  around the world. </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This article will discuss the legal actions against Western museums and the legal and ethical actions towards the anthropological community. It will continue with a discussion on the federal aspects of archaeology and its shift towards <b>decolonization</b>. There have been great strides in reform for both Canada and the United States in its fieldwork and in its treatment towards the Indigenous population, but there is always room for improvement.&nbsp; I believe that this paper will reaffirm the importance of supporting both living and past cultures within archaeology. (Nelly - I</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="943407" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cultural actions towards museums and artifacts</h2><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a society that is governed by law that all must be held  to it. What about the cultural appropriation? When the time came that the  colonies of the empires around the world became independent they needed to find  a way to build an identity in the colony. Canada and America were doing exactly  that. Though America was doing more to form an identity than Canada. This  identity was formed by appropriating the Indigenous peoples’ ideas and saying  that they are all one, European settlers and the Indigenous. There are many  legal issues that have arisen from this and very little has been done to  rectify these legal issues within the system of both Canada and America. The  legal and ethical struggles that have been a constant battle between the  governments and Indigenous groups is important to discuss, especially when it  has to do with colonialization. Here in Canada in the early 20th  century we were about the collection of Indigenous material goods and artifacts  simply because assimilation was believed to happen to the Indigenous  communities. While in America it was more for commodification of textiles and  other types of Knick-knacks and adopting their culture to make it their own. Both  methods in Canada and America are equal part colonial and national.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring the legal system on&nbsp;<b>repatronization</b>, Canada  itself has lagged behind in comparison to America. It was missing the idea of  how the Indigenous people have been viewed and the way they view the act of  ‘owning’ something. In an article written in 1979 by Bowen, he argued this idea  of ownership. The idea that Indigenous people view ownership as a collective  rather than as individual ownership. This ownership is nothing new here in the  20th and 21st century since these battles are still going  today. Techniques of collecting material culture by anthropologists were rooted in a colonial nature of viewing Indigenous groups as a 'dying race'.&nbsp;<b>(Delaney - I added this point to highlight some of the colonial influenced ideas of early archaeology in North America)</b> An example of ownership problems comes from commodification of  Indigenous items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Manual2013}</cite>. This  commodification of goods helped to Westernize the Indigenous items which may  have been only used for ceremonies or other events and have minor profit for  the Indigenous community. Another is the appropriation of sacred items or  remains from communities that should stay with those Indigenous communities;  like that of the Zuni and their twin war gods or even the remains of the  “<b>Kennewick man</b>”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979,Searles2017}</cite>. &nbsp;It is important for us to evaluate these  issues to understand not just the view of the archaeologist and museums but  also the view of the Indigenous people. Since archaeology aims to examine and preserve the past, it is understandable that anthropologists in the 20th  century were collecting “artifacts” from Indigenous peoples that they assumed were destined to disappear&nbsp;<b>(Rachael- expanded on this thought)</b>. The legal  battles that have and are happening in America and Canada are challenging cases,  considering they view these artifacts as both art and important religious items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. Though work has  been done to correct this by museums where they either willing gave up those  items to the indigenous people or even made requirements for them to get these  items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal system in the Americas’ was one sided. Settlers  would be allowed to claim land that they land on and that the Indigenous people  had no claim to it since they were not a recognized sovereign nation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. This was changed  though after the British won the Seven-year war with France and claimed New  France where a new deal was struck that allowed the Indigenous people to have  their own lands and deny the access to private groups&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. Despite this new deal, Indigenous people have still struggled to assert their land rights. Private companies and government policies to this day continue to act as an antagonist to Indigenous groups (<b>Kevin. I added this to avoid draw attention to the fact that land rights are still violated</b>). In Canada, during the early 20th  century museums were more to show off the exploits of individuals and the  greatness of the parent nation where only the rich would be able to see the  museums&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Buchanan2014}</cite>. This meaning that  our system was colonial and viewing the Indigenous people as a culture that  will die out due to the technology of the West&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Buchanan2014}</cite>,  thankfully this was not true. What happened was the growth – much like that of  America – in using museums as nation builders. The differences of America and  Canada was the path they used to get to nation building as highlighted by  Willmott. America used a democratic styled where everything within their  sovereign borders was American; while in Canada it was a more assimilation or  colonial style, displaying the items of primitive cultures to compare the  advances by technology and the majesty of the Western ideology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Willmott2014,Manual2013}</cite>. This method helped  to affirm the legal rights of the government in Canada to collect the items of  a dying culture as in Buchanan’s article explained about the three individuals  and their views on how Canada should treat the Indigenous communities.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These legal actions have had important impacts on the  archaeology field within anthropology. These legal actions helped to pave the  way for current archaeology where building of stronger relations and reforms  were important to ensure all parties are under fair legal certainty.  Unfortunately, not all these legal cases ended well for the Indigenous  community. Many legal actions in both Canada and America were in favour of the  museums or government due to issues of proper housing for the items. In America,  many times the museums would only allow the release of the demanded artifacts if  they were housed in proper museums on the Indigenous communities’ land, this  was virtually impossible for that to happen&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. While in Canada,  the paying of individuals to buy Indigenous artifacts to be displayed in  museums was a common thing and even the purchasing of totem poles to be  displayed in the museums&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Willmott2014}</cite>. What this caused  though is the steps towards a better start for archaeology for the public  rallied to help Indigenous people to reclaim their artifacts and seen the  reforms to the field. </div><div>    </div><h2 data-label="908007" class="ltx_title_subsection">Relations with Indigenous Communities.</h2><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring the relations that museums and archaeologists  have had with Indigenous communities they have not always been the best. Indigenous  groups saw the museums and archaeologists as looters, the vary people they were  trying to prevent from stealing artifacts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. While legal actions were taken to  prevent looters, it seemed to not stop archaeologists from coming in to claim  the artifacts which by law saw them as the owners of the artifacts&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. This gave rise to  the advocacy by the public to give back but still not all was returned.  Advocacy is an amazing tool that archaeologists use to support their claims and  reasoning behind removing artifacts of past cultures, but this does have harm  on the living descendants of still living cultures. Relations with these living  Indigenous cultures is documented more in Canada rather than America. America  does have cases but there is more extensive knowledge from the Canadian  anthropologist and archaeologist.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know of  archaeology today, we view ourselves as protectors and advocates to material  goods left behind by past cultures. This has not changed. Archaeologists saw  themselves as doing the same thing back in the 20th century as well. It is important to remember that many human remains are the cultural property of living groups. When remains make up a significant percentage of the exhibits within a museum,   this can become problematic, especially if they had been collected many years ago and without permission&nbsp;<b>(Rachael: split one sentence into two and added details)</b>. The museums of America and Canada have  had their fair share of such issues. In Canada, the conflict was with the  finding of the “<b>Kennewick man</b>” which was a 9,400 year-old skeleton found in the  Arctic and sparked problems with the archaeologists involved with it&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Searles2017}</cite>.  While in America the&nbsp;<b>NAGPRA</b> was created to help control these conflicts with  museums and archaeologists (Sullivan, Abraham, &amp; Griffin, 2000). This act helped  museums to build a better relationship with Indigenous people and in turn  helped the museums get a more authentic exhibit from their knowledge that they  knew about artifacts within the museum.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With relations being important for archaeologists and  museums to understand repatriation is a clear point to have when dealing with  legalities of ownership. This after all, improves your exhibits and which  improves the records that are being kept. This means updating or change of the  archaeological ethics code in countries that have Indigenous peoples within  their national borders. Relations with Indigenous groups may be different from  group to group like in the Arctic Searles saying that he did not encounter the  same problems that others were having due to the “<b>Kennewick man</b>” in the 1989. </div><div>    </div><h2>Archaeological reforms of Canada and America.</h2><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When speaking of reforms in archaeology it is more to do  with the change ethics. This change in the ethics of allowed for more of a  voice to be given to the Indigenous groups that may and are involved with the  archaeological sites. Organizations such as CAA here in Canada, the SAA in  America and other organizations have helped to define guidelines for  archaeologists about Indigenous communities. It is a crucial step that was  taken by archaeologist in the 1990’s to include the Indigenous people since  they are still a living culture. The first conference of archaeologists was a  global one and was the first code of ethics to be created that included  Indigenous people&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. While <b>SOPA</b> or  Society of Professional Archaeologists created a code of ethics that help to  support the archaeologist within a legal measure <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. These conferences and societies were  important to help push archaeology into the modern era.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeology has been based within a colonial framework.  Removal of artifacts and items to be displayed within museums for the public to  see and to promote nationality and depending on where you are in the world,  modernity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>. When speaking of  modernity, it is an idea that a government wants to be like that of the West or  where ever they see as modern. In Indonesia, museums were built as a display of  modernism and nationalism but depending on where you were the museums felt  distant from the public <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>.  Museums themselves -viewed personally – are constructs of the past colonial  structure and which confines the archaeological evidence within it. What is  needed is the following of what some museums in Indonesia have done and hiring  local people of the tribe that the museum focuses on which helps to strengthen  the relationship of the institute and allow for more authentic exhibits to be  performed <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kreps1998}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These go along with the idea of inclusion of Indigenous  people in-line with the creation of the codes of ethics by the archaeological  society and groups. The study that was conducted though by Rosenswig (1997)  shows that the reforms showed clear cut how each society focused on the  Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This means that in the ethical actions of  archaeologists who may work for museums and universities have protection to  make sure that all parties are equally represented. With SOPA’s code of ethics  the archaeologist must follow guidelines or will be discredited and also for  the WAC code of ethics it highly encouraged the employment of indigenous people  in the field. These code of ethics from former colonies as well helped to protect  themselves and the archaeologist within legal framework because the Indigenous  people were given a voice and an equal share&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>. The codes also differed from country  to country and Canada was the only nation to use “spirit” within the CAA code  of ethics while in America the SAA was for the mercantile and preservation of Indigenous  artifacts <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Rosenswig1997}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with some of these changes happening in the 1990’s it  is still relevant to acknowledge the changes that took place. These changes  helped to give more of a voice to the Indigenous people on what artifacts would  be displayed by museums and collected by archaeologists. Another is the change  in the way the world was viewing the Indigenous people. The view that everyone  had has now become a more protective society of it and that the importance of  their culture must be there to preserve the Indigenous autonomy when it comes  to living cultures artifacts. This legal framework also helped to build a  better relationship with the nations own Indigenous people and gave also the  nation their own guidelines to control how artifacts should be treated within  national borders.</div><div>    </div><h2>Reflection to the changes in museums and archaeology.</h2><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude this section, it is evident   to myself that there is still much work needing to be done. Canada and America   both need to be willing to relinquish the items – not artifacts since   artifacts mean material remains of a past and not living culture – for the   ownership of such items belongs to that of the Indigenous community. It is   understandable that both parties do want to keep the items and have good   claims but truly the items deserve to be with their proper owners. These items   have more important symbolism than we can understand and deserve to be with   people that understand them. Though this paper is not here to state that “this   is the way we need to correct these problems,” it is here to shed more light   on the subject. As advocates this is what needs to be done to ensure the   continued trust and support of Indigenous communities which is highlighted in   Searles’s article. We as the advocates for the Indigenous community it is   relevant to bring to light the changes that need to be done in not just   archaeology but in anthropology, as well.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeology has significant role to help people from all  ethnics to be proud of their past cultures and same too does anthropology have  to that of present cultures. It is important to note that museums play a big  part in constructing a national identity. This national identity helps to  de-construct the colonialism of the nation but also replaces it with a  commodifying effect on the country. What is important is the education of  people, both Indigenous and non-indigenous, for that is a start de-construct  this cycle of colonialism. In the start of Donald’s article, he gives a story  about how he went to a fort in Edmonton, Alberta and at this fort he realized  the myth construct of the fort and the wilderness; the civilized and the  primitive. The educational system needs to be this reforming and informational  part to help separate the colonialism that has gripped our country and that of  others&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Donald2009}</cite>. It is evident that  even sharing our message from here in Canada to that of other places of the  world is important since not all nations have this ethics code to share. It  needs to be there to help improve the lives of all Indigenous people, but it  will show problems too like in South Africa with the Boers <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that de-colonialization of Canadian anthropology  is best to be confronted by advocacy and education is going to be the best  practical options. Here in Canada, we need to be the advocates of this change  and be at the frontlines to protect Indigenous items from the environment and  ourselves. This model of taking or looting as they would see it needs to be changed  to end this colonial cycle and in-turn means the need of a new model. When  Plaice went to South Africa and explained their thesis to South African  anthropologists it sent a ripple that surprised them since they were dealing  with a unique type of Indigeneity&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>. This form of  Indigeneity was about the Boers and how they claimed to be Indigenous to South  Africa, yet they were descendants of Dutch colonialists <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>. This posed a problem where the  Indigenous majority where surprised to see a small group having such power over  a government&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Plaice2014}</cite>.</div><div>     &nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>The Decolonization of Archaeological Practices</b> ( In progress )</div><div>                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonialism within the discipline of archaeology can be traced back to the Missionary Era, where explorers and missionaries encountered indigenous peoples during their travels <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hancock2006}</cite>. The HMS&nbsp;<i>Investigator</i> was an example of this, sailing in search of the Franklin expedition that went missing in 1845 looking for the North-West Passage.&nbsp; During their voyage, they became trapped in the ice of Mercy Bay and abandoned ship in 1853. &nbsp;The crew cached most of their remaining supplies onshore where tins and barrels were discovered and utilized by Inuinnait (Copper Inuit) groups from neighbouring islands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ethnocentric</b> attitudes towards indigenous peoples were prevalent during this time and there was no exception within the crew members of the&nbsp;<i>Investigator</i>.&nbsp; The journals of Captain Robert McClure, surgeon Alexander Armstrong, Inuktitut translator Johann Miertsching, and seaman James Nelson described the Inuit to be primitive, immoral, filthy, and simple children of nature&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hodgetts2012}</cite>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These attitudes displaying Indigenous inferiority greatly influenced early archaeological interpretation.&nbsp; Clifford Hickey, an archaeologist who studied the Inuinnait groups in the 1980s proposed that their culture underwent a significant transformation due to the influx of goods from the&nbsp;<i>Investigator</i>.&nbsp; He argued that groups closest to Mercy Bay had exclusive access to these objects in which created an unfair advantage in trading and led to significant differences between the Inuinnait and other Inuit groups. &nbsp;Archaeological interpretations such as these showed a unidirectional approach; a one-way flow of ideas and change from colonizers to colonized.&nbsp; In the case of the HMS&nbsp;<i>Investigator</i>, we see a focus on how the goods found from the&nbsp;<i>Investigator</i> were portrayed to have ‘transformed’ Inuit culture instead of examining the ways in which those goods were incorporated into or resisted by existing cultural practices.&nbsp; Today, archaeologists strive to recognize the complexities of the individual and group identities  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hodgetts2012}</cite>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div><div>  </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Amateur Era was quite influential towards Iroquoian archaeology in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&nbsp; While these amateurs were largely unprofessional, they were essential towards the archaeological process in documenting sites, excavation, and the interpretation of human remains.&nbsp; Unfortunately due to their lack in experience, costly mistakes were made in retrieving archaeological material from the sites.&nbsp; Excavators would often fill ossuaries with stones and logs, or break bones from digging with shovels.&nbsp; There were also issues with the public’s interpretation of the archaeological record, often portraying First Nations as noble savages or evil barbarians. &nbsp;The media would add to this stigma by publishing articles that would place past Indigenous populations in constant warfare, thus interpreting ossuaries as a result of large battles.&nbsp; Artifacts were also described through a colonial lens where the material was viewed as “rough”, “rude”, or “unfinished”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hamilton2006}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>                          </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The National Museum Era brought about important figures such as Edward Sapir and Marius Barbeau.&nbsp; Edward Sapir was greatly influenced by Franz Boas, an American cultural anthropologist who brought about theoretical approaches such as&nbsp;<b>historical</b>&nbsp;<b>particularism</b> and&nbsp;<b>cultural</b>&nbsp;<b>relativism</b>.&nbsp; During this time, Boas was extremely concerned about the extinction of Native North American cultures and introduced&nbsp;<b>salvage ethnography&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{murphy2008}</cite></b>.&nbsp; This method of ethnographic analysis inspired Marius Barbeau, who worked to preserve “authentic” traditional cultures.&nbsp; His work mainly focused on oral traditions, songs, and genealogies from various Indigenous cultures, as well as legends, old furniture, wood carvings, and other materials from rural French Canada.&nbsp; Barbeau believed that early-twentieth-century Canadian anthropologists saw themselves as “pioneers” in correcting popular misconceptions about Indigenous cultures and preserving cultural records and artifacts that would be forever lost <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{nurse2006}</cite>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbeau took this colonial methodology one step further and proposed a series of research tactics in recovering authentic elements of supposedly dying cultures.&nbsp; The requirements for Barbeau’s fieldwork needed an approach to efficiently collect cultural traits for archives and museums, in other words, for collection not observation or understanding.&nbsp; He approached this task by producing steps in acquiring material such as finding an effective research site with trustworthy informants.&nbsp; These individuals had to be uneducated because he believed that educated informants failed to understand their heritage and were not authentic.&nbsp; They also needed to be elders, from lower social classes, and those with little to no contact with surrounding cultures.&nbsp; Barbeau made it very clear that he was not interested in the informants’ oppinions or social views, just their memories&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{nurse2006}</cite>.&nbsp;He was influenced by these colonial methods in that he kept a distance between himself and his informants as he believed he devalued his research&nbsp;<b>- Delaney, added this short point to highlight early anthropologists' colonial influences)</b></div>
