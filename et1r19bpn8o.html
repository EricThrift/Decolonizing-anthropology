Museums and anthropology have  worked together to provide a glimpse into the cultures of the world. The way  they have done this is by artifacts. Artifacts normally are remnants of past  cultures that have died out over the centuries. Thanks to these artifacts we  are given a better understanding of how life may have been for them, since most  artifacts are within scientific certainty of the archaeologists’ perspective.  Though the artifacts in question here would be that of a past civilization but  what about a living culture? Does it not mean that living cultures ‘artifacts’  are actually important ritual items or maybe something more? Why does  anthropology support these tendencies to remove these artifacts from a  community that view such things as sacred? </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of anthropology and even during the time  of antiquity collection of past cultures artifacts was a sign of heritage. This  heritage that an individual would display would play to their advantage to help  push forward their claim to something that is greater. For newly formed nations  such as America, Canada and the other parts of the America’s this clinging onto  need to have a strong national identity like that of their colonial parent. The  difference between the colony and the parent nation is that of living people  being there and already having an identity. What is needing to be noted is how  the new colonies viewed the living people there already. What is evident is the  need for more legal representation of Indigenous groups in the Americas and  around the world. </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This article will discuss the legal actions against Western museums and the legal and ethical actions towards the anthropological community. &nbsp;It will continue with a discussion on the federal aspects of archaeology and its shift towards&nbsp;<b>decolonization</b>. There have been great strides in reform for both Canada and the United States in its fieldwork and in its treatment towards the Indigenous population, but there is always room for improvement.&nbsp; I believe that this paper will reaffirm the importance of supporting both living and past cultures within archaeology. <b>(Nelly - I've edited and condensed this paragraph)</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="943407" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cultural actions towards museums and artifacts</h2><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a society that is governed by law that all must be held  to it. What about the cultural appropriation? When the time came that the  colonies of the empires around the world became independent they needed to find  a way to build an identity in the colony. Canada and America were doing exactly  that. Though America was doing more to form an identity than Canada. This  identity was formed by appropriating the Indigenous peoples’ ideas and saying  that they are all one, European settlers and the Indigenous. There are many  legal issues that have arisen from this and very little has been done to  rectify these legal issues within the system of both Canada and America. The  legal and ethical struggles that have been a constant battle between the  governments and Indigenous groups is important to discuss, especially when it  has to do with colonialization. Here in Canada in the early 20th  century we were about the collection of Indigenous material goods and artifacts  simply because assimilation was believed to happen to the Indigenous  communities. While in America it was more for commodification of textiles and  other types of Knick-knacks and adopting their culture to make it their own. Both  methods in Canada and America are equal part colonial and national.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring the legal system on&nbsp;<b>repatriation</b>, Canada  itself has lagged behind in comparison to America. It was missing the idea of  how the Indigenous people have been viewed and the way they view the act of  ‘owning’ something. In an article written in 1979 by Bowen, he argued this idea  of ownership. The idea that Indigenous people view ownership as a collective  rather than as individual ownership. This ownership is nothing new here in the  20th and 21st century since these battles are still going  today. Techniques of collecting material culture by anthropologists were rooted in a colonial nature of viewing Indigenous groups as a 'dying race'.&nbsp;<b>(Delaney - I added this point to highlight some of the colonial influenced ideas of early archaeology in North America)</b> An example of ownership problems comes from commodification of  Indigenous items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Manual2013}</cite>. This  commodification of goods helped to Westernize the Indigenous items which may  have been only used for ceremonies or other events and have minor profit for  the Indigenous community. Another is the appropriation of sacred items or  remains from communities that should stay with those Indigenous communities;  like that of the Zuni and their twin war gods or even the remains of the  “<b>Kennewick man</b>”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979,Searles2017}</cite>. &nbsp;It is important for us to evaluate these  issues to understand not just the view of the archaeologist and museums but  also the view of the Indigenous people. Since archaeology aims to examine and preserve the past, it is understandable that anthropologists in the 20th  century were collecting “artifacts” from Indigenous peoples that they assumed were destined to disappear&nbsp;<b>(Rachael- expanded on this thought)</b>. The legal  battles that have and are happening in America and Canada are challenging cases,  considering they view these artifacts as both art and important religious items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. Though work has  been done to correct this by museums where they either willing gave up those  items to the indigenous people or even made requirements for them to get these  items&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal system in the Americas’ was one sided. Settlers  would be allowed to claim land that they land on and that the Indigenous people  had no claim to it since they were not a recognized sovereign nation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. This was changed  though after the British won the Seven-year war with France and claimed New  France where a new deal was struck that allowed the Indigenous people to have  their own lands and deny the access to private groups&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. Despite this new deal, Indigenous people have still struggled to assert their land rights. Private companies and government policies to this day continue to act as an antagonist to Indigenous groups (<b>Kevin. I added this to avoid draw attention to the fact that land rights are still violated</b>). In Canada, during the early 20th  century museums were more to show off the exploits of individuals and the  greatness of the parent nation where only the rich would be able to see the  museums&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Buchanan2014}</cite>. This meaning that  our system was colonial and viewing the Indigenous people as a culture that  will die out due to the technology of the West&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Buchanan2014}</cite>,  thankfully this was not true. What happened was the growth – much like that of  America – in using museums as nation builders. The differences of America and  Canada was the path they used to get to nation building as highlighted by  Willmott. America used a democratic styled where everything within their  sovereign borders was American; while in Canada it was a more assimilation or  colonial style, displaying the items of primitive cultures to compare the  advances by technology and the majesty of the Western ideology&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Willmott2014,Manual2013}</cite>. This method helped  to affirm the legal rights of the government in Canada to collect the items of  a dying culture as in Buchanan’s article explained about the three individuals  and their views on how Canada should treat the Indigenous communities.</div><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These legal actions have had important impacts on the  archaeology field within anthropology. These legal actions helped to pave the  way for current archaeology where building of stronger relations and reforms  were important to ensure all parties are under fair legal certainty.  Unfortunately, not all these legal cases ended well for the Indigenous  community. Many legal actions in both Canada and America were in favour of the  museums or government due to issues of proper housing for the items. In America,  many times the museums would only allow the release of the demanded artifacts if  they were housed in proper museums on the Indigenous communities’ land, this  was virtually impossible for that to happen&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. While in Canada,  the paying of individuals to buy Indigenous artifacts to be displayed in  museums was a common thing and even the purchasing of totem poles to be  displayed in the museums&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Willmott2014}</cite>. What this caused  though is the steps towards a better start for archaeology for the public  rallied to help Indigenous people to reclaim their artifacts and seen the  reforms to the field. </div><div>    </div><h2 data-label="908007" class="ltx_title_subsection">Relations with Indigenous Communities.</h2><div>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring the relations that museums and archaeologists  have had with Indigenous communities they have not always been the best. Indigenous  groups saw the museums and archaeologists as looters, the vary people they were  trying to prevent from stealing artifacts&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Ferris2003}</cite>. While legal actions were taken to  prevent looters, it seemed to not stop archaeologists from coming in to claim  the artifacts which by law saw them as the owners of the artifacts&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Blair1979}</cite>. This gave rise to public advocacy groups that sought the repatriation of artifacts, such as a petition started in Saskatchewan that called for the return of Louis Riel's walking stick(<b>Breanna- reworded and expanded to clarify, and added an example.</b>).  Advocacy is an amazing tool that archaeologists use to support their claims and  reasoning behind removing artifacts of past cultures, but this does have harm  on the living descendants of still living cultures. Relations with these living  Indigenous cultures is documented more in Canada rather than America. America  does have cases but there is more extensive knowledge from the Canadian  anthropologist and archaeologist.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know of  archaeology today, we view ourselves as protectors and advocates to material  goods left behind by past cultures. This has not changed. Archaeologists saw  themselves as doing the same thing back in the 20th century as well. It is important to remember that many human remains are the cultural property of living groups. When remains make up a significant percentage of the exhibits within a museum,   this can become problematic, especially if they had been collected many years ago and without permission&nbsp;<b>(Rachael: split one sentence into two and added details)</b>. The museums of America and Canada have  had their fair share of such issues. In Canada, the conflict was with the  finding of the “<b>Kennewick man</b>” which was a 9,400 year-old skeleton found in Kennewick, Washington and sparked problems with the archaeologists involved with it and here in Canada&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Searles2017}</cite>. In America the&nbsp;<b>NAGPRA</b> was created to help control these conflicts with  museums and archaeologists (Sullivan, Abraham, &amp; Griffin, 2000). This act helped  museums to build a better relationship with Indigenous people and in turn  helped the museums get a more authentic exhibit from their knowledge that they  knew about artifacts within the museum.&nbsp;</div><div> &nbsp;</div>
