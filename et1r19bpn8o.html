Museums and anthropology have  worked together to provide a glimpse into the cultures of the world. The way  they have done this is by artifacts. Artifacts normally are remnants of past  cultures that have died out over the centuries. Thanks to these artifacts we  are given a better understanding of how life may have been for them, since most  artifacts are within scientific certainty of the archaeologists’ perspective.  Though the artifacts in question here would be that of a past civilization but  what about a living culture? Does it not mean that living cultures ‘artifacts’  are actually important ritual items or maybe something more? Why does  anthropology support these tendencies to remove these artifacts from a  community that view such things as sacred? </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of anthropology and even during the time  of antiquity collection of past cultures artifacts was a sign of heritage. This  heritage that an individual would display would play to their advantage to help  push forward their claim to something that is greater. For newly formed nations  such as America, Canada and the other parts of the America’s this clinging onto  need to have a strong national identity like that of their colonial parent. The  difference between the colony and the parent nation is that of living people  being there and already having an identity. What is needing to be noted is how  the new colonies viewed the living people there already. What is evident is the  need for more legal representation of Indigenous groups in the Americas and  around the world. </div><div></div><div>As this paper will be discussing the legal actions that have  been taken against Western museums and what legal and ethical actions have been  done within the anthropology community itself.    </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section will also be considering the archaeological side  of anthropology. Meaning it will have more information from a federal aspect to it and possibly to deconstruct the <b>colonialism</b> in archaeology.  With archaeology being closely attached to the colonialism it is important to  separate this. Throughout this paper it will be one of the goals to help  separate that side of the archaeology to move forward. Canada and America both  have done great reforms to the field and treatment of Indigenous people but  there is always more needing to be done. I believe that within this paper it  will be affirmed that archaeology, even though working with governments, must  be the advocates of both living and past cultures.  &nbsp;</div><div>                    </div><div></div><div>  </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>      </div>
