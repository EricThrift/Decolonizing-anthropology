Museums and anthropology have  worked together to provide a glimpse into the cultures of the world. The way  they have done this is by artifacts. Artifacts normally are remnants of past  cultures that have died out over the centuries. Thanks to these artifacts we  are given a better understanding of how life may have been for them, since most  artifacts are within scientific certainty of the archaeologists’ perspective.  Though the artifacts in question here would be that of a past civilization but  what about a living culture? Does it not mean that living cultures ‘artifacts’  are actually important ritual items or maybe something more? Why does  anthropology support these tendencies to remove these artifacts from a  community that view such things as sacred? </div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of anthropology and even during the time  of antiquity collection of past cultures artifacts was a sign of heritage. This  heritage that an individual would display would play to their advantage to help  push forward their claim to something that is greater. For newly formed nations  such as America, Canada and the other parts of the America’s this clinging onto  need to have a strong national identity like that of their colonial parent. The  difference between the colony and the parent nation is that of living people  being there and already having an identity. What is needing to be noted is how  the new colonies viewed the living people there already. What is evident is the  need for more legal representation of Indigenous groups in the Americas and  around the world. </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This article will discuss the legal actions against Western museums and the legal and ethical actions towards the anthropological community. It will continue with a discussion on the federal aspects of archaeology and its shift towards decoloni<b></b>za<b></b>tion. There have been great strides in reform for both Canada and the United States in its fieldwork and in its treatment towards the Indigenous population, but there is always room for improvement.&nbsp; I believe that this paper will reaffirm the importance of supporting both living and past cultures within archaeology.&nbsp;</div>
