<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  grade 11 history course is another course that has taken strides to incorporate  Indigenous perspectives. <i>Shaping Canada:  Our History from Our Beginnings to the Present</i>, the provincially mandated  textbook has undergone significant changes from the previous textbook used, <i>Our Canada</i>. Numerous <b>emendations </b>have been made. <i>Shaping Canada</i>, published in 2011, was  written by Manitoban authors in consultation with educational advisors,  historians, and elders from across the province. Topics range from the First  Peoples and their way of life, to settlement and colonization, Confederation,  and the challenges and achievements of the country. Included are also the  issues of residential schools, reconciliation, and decolonization. The  Indigenous perspectives in this textbook are not reduced to s single chapter,  but are included throughout each area of study. One of the most notable <b>emendations </b>is the language used when  referring to Indigenous peoples. Instead of using the colonial names given to  certain language groups or areas, the textbook uses that traditional names used  by the Indigenous peoples. For example, “Anishinaabe” is used instead of the  colonial term “Ojibwe” or “Cree” (Connor, Hull, Wyatt-Anderson 2011, p. 21). Furthermore,  the textbook acknowledges the importance of traditional oral histories and  stories, incorporates teachings of the Medicine Wheel, and discussed the  archaeological evidence for and against the Land Bridge Theory. Along with the  improvements to the textbook, the History class is also incorporating  Indigenous perspectives by undertaking an oral history project to document the  history of families in the Rolling River First Nation community. This project  allows students to experience the power or oral histories and gain knowledge  from lived experiences. ECI has made enormous progress in the incorporation of  Indigenous knowledge into their curricula but it is important to maintain a  balance between cultures so that one is not privileged over another. This is  evidenced by the school having the highest aboriginal graduation rates in the  province, the highest pass rate on the English Provincial Exam, and a  noticeable reduction in the gaps of reading levels (Lee 2017). The division,  the school, and the educators and staff, have done an excellent job at  maintaining that balance and continue to improve upon their curricula in a  holistic way that will equally benefit all of the students. </div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Educational  anthropology has a strong colonial background from the colonial schools that  anthropologists have developed curricula for to the study of residential  schools in Canada, but an attempt has continuously been made to move toward  decolonization. The development of the sub-field saw conferences held that encouraged  localization of education, the incorporation of Indigenous knowledges, and a  departure from enforcing Western ideals of education. Current trends in  educational anthropology and curriculum development are seeing an increase in  attempts to decolonize both anthropology and education through the infusion of  Indigenous perspectives and land-based learning. Rolling River School Division  and Erickson Collegiate are excellent examples of how these new ideals can be  successfully implemented to improve the education and lives of all students in  a holistic manner. The cooperation between anthropologists and educators in the  study of education is a necessity to decolonize Canadian anthropology and  education.&nbsp;</div><div>                                      </div><div>Bibliography</div><div>Elizabeth Eddy.
