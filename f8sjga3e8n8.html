<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autoethnography is a multifaceted approach to anthropology, allowing for it to combat colonialism in many ways. An alternative to Murphy’s autoethnographic approach, where an anthropologist studies their own culture, is the work of Julie Cruikshank. Cruikshank translates and contextualizes the narratives of indigenous women. In Life Lived Like a Story Cruikshank collaborates with three Athapaskan and Tlingit women from the Yukon, focusing on how these women utilize narrative to explain their life histories as well as their culture <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cruikshank1990}</cite>. While at first the stories of these women might come across as autobiographical, an examination makes it evident that these narratives are laden with anthropological insight, addressing social contexts, kinship, and the value of stories <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Cruikshank1990}</cite>. Collaborative autoethnography diverges from conventional participant observation by giving the observed their own voices. This approach remedies Barbeau’s questionable methodology and its perpetuation of colonial power. By allowing Indigenous people to be an authority on their own culture not only do we renegotiate power balances, but we gain an unfiltered anthropological account of a culture from someone who has been immersed in it for the majority of their life. </div><div>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using autoethnography as a means to decolonize anthropology extends beyond a progressive approach to fieldwork. Autoethnography is not only a polymorphous remedy to colonial anthropology, but is also an intersection for other anthropological methods. For instance, autoethnography is an ideal vessel for public anthropology, making it doubly effective at decolonization. Louise Lamphere states that public anthropology is based in “increased collaboration and partnership with communities we study, expanded outreach to the public so that research results are broadly disseminated, and concrete efforts to influence policy” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{lamphere2009}</cite>. Because autoethnography often focuses on these issues its efforts to decolonize are intertwined with public anthropology. An instance of this anthropological intersectionality can be seen in Joel Martineau’s work Autoethnography and Material Culture: The Case of Bill Reid. In this work Martineau examines how the sculptures of Bill Reid, the prolific Canadian artist, elaborate on the methodology of autoethnography. Contrary to Pratt’s definition of autoethnography, Martineau argues that Reid’s art can be read as “autoethnographic texts” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Martineau2001}</cite>. When material culture is interpreted as autoethnographic work colonialism is challenged by a shift away from Eurocentric mediums. It has been argued that academic writing has an English bias <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{curry2010}</cite>. This poses a challenge to Indigenous people who look to represent their own culture to an academic audience without assuming the role of subject. Not only are indigenous people required to use English if they look to portray their own culture, but they also need an understanding of “concepts and categories historically and epistemologically defined by that language” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ryang1997}</cite>. Consequently, a contradiction arises which questions the viability of autoethnography when limited to English academic writing; to present one’s own culture a degree of assimilation or adaptation is necessary for it to be presentable. Autoethnography through material culture, exemplified by Reid, transcends conventional academic mediums and allows for the incorporation of Indigenous ones, facilitating cultural introspection without conforming to colonial powers. While not to say all writing is colonial, if Indigenous people are allowed to convey their own histories and cultural understandings through their own mediums we remove an underlying colonial aspect of anthropology.</div><div></div>
