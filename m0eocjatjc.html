<h1 data-label="753388" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div><i>    </i>Colonialism today is still an issue that affects us. This is why discussions are needed to be made on how we can move forward out of this framework. Looking at the cultural appropriation that was done to fill museums without the consent of the indigenous communities is still a problem that is needing to be fixed, thankfully it is. Whether it is done be reforms to the code of ethics or by federal acts such as the NAGPRA it shows that we are moving away from the colonialism framework, even if it is slow. These discussions and acts are needing to continue and improve for once we start working together not only will we be preserving a culture, we will be making sure even our most colonial institutions - museums - are inclusive and better than they are now.(Cody<i>    </i></div>
