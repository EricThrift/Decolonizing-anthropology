This is why discussions are needed to be made on how we can move forward out of this framework. Looking at the cultural appropriation that was done to fill museums without the consent of the indigenous communities is still a problem that is needing to be fixed, thankfully it is. Whether it is done be reforms to the code of ethics or by federal acts such as the NAGPRA it shows that we are moving away from the colonialism framework, even if it is slow. We cannot afford to revert back to the armchair anthropology that was practiced or ignore the colonial past that our country has endured. Discussions and acts are needed to continue and improve. For, once we start working together not only will we be preserving cultures, we will be making sure even our most colonial institutions - museums - are inclusive and better than they are now. This does not mean that there needs to be no more work in the area but means that we should always looks to improve the system. The changes should come from all sides whether it is giving voices to the indigenous community or reforming the education system. The work to end colonialism in Canada is a process that is still being worked and will continue until we are able to equal incorporate the indigenous people fairly throughout the country. To keep in mind is that we do not have all the answers to grand theories that have been made in the past but what we do have is the knowledge from then to build a better future to make sure cultures and societies grow the way that is natural for them; even after colonialism.   &nbsp;</div><div><b>Kevin -&nbsp;</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachael -&nbsp;</b>Our colonial history encouraged men of European descent to fill the positions of power in society, forming roadblocks for minority populations and, at times, denying them their rights all together. As society gradually shifts away from these trends, positions of power are created, settled, and utilized by individuals who formerly would never have had access to them. Alongside obvious institutions such as politics and business, this trend extends to education, cultural work, and anthropology. Underlying colonial issues are being exposed. Accessible media brings these issues to a far wider audience than there would have been a century ago. People are calling for change—both from within and from outside these institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most base level, the primary and secondary education system inform the worldview of the next generation. An increasingly detailed and accurate portrayal of both colonial history and indigenous cultures prevents stereotyping or a misunderstanding of our country’s history. Museums do much the same to a wider demographic, informing the cultural identity and historical understanding of Canadian citizens by highlighting rich indigenous cultural heritages. To achieve these changes, and in response to new demands, shifts in methodology have taken place that encourage more nuanced and complete explorations of culture. Autoethnographies and collaborative methodology are two examples of new perspectives being incorporated into anthropological research. As methodology adjusts to our society’s theoretical shift away from colonialism, more thorough research is conducted, and more people benefit.</div><div> &nbsp;<b>Delaney -&nbsp;</b>The emergence and beginnings of anthropology has been influenced by its past ties to colonialism and there has been a gradual shift to move away from these practices through postmodernism theories and the rejection of grand theories. Canadian anthropology especially has struggled with coming to terms with its own distinct identity and anthropologists have responded to colonial critiques by taking an active role in their research and creating participant observation and collaborative techniques with their subjects. Anthropologists have begun to become committed to improving the lives of others through their research and have become whistleblowers, specifically in Indigenous groups advocating on behalf. Material remains through archaeology and in museums were collected through colonization and efforts have been increasingly made in order to repatriate this loss of culture. Education remains one of the most essential ways to decolonize anthropology as newer subfields such as applied anthropology have emerged to combat these past colonial ties. Colonial anthropology was exclusive and with postmodernism techniques and through education it has become a more inclusive discipline. Techniques such as oral traditions, collaborative and auto-ethnography have introduced diversity in anthropological methods that decolonize the discipline. Decolonizing anthropology in Canada is also achieved through a balanced relationship between anthropologists and Indigenous groups through active participation. Minority groups the subject of fieldwork are now given the power to dictate who conducts research in the communities and how it will and should benefit the participants positively.</div><div><b>Nelly</b> -&nbsp;                    New tools are being produced within anthropology to work in decolonizing the discipline.&nbsp; One of the methodologies is autoethnography, which uses an introspective approach to its work.&nbsp; Instead of only playing the role of the observer, one now fuses both etic and emic perspectives to understand all the sentiments – those who are being observed and the observer.&nbsp; Collaborative anthropology employs a similar approach where it allows for all voices to be heard with no censorship.&nbsp; Archaeologists in particular are making great strides in improving their fieldwork methods from past practices.&nbsp; Instead of taking on the role as the expert in ancient materials, they are now applying collaborative approaches to include the Indigenous populations within their work. This inclusion of the Indigenous perspective reinforces the shift away from its colonial past.&nbsp; Finally, the access to our past through education is crucial in understanding ourselves as individuals and within a community.&nbsp; By incorporating Indigenous practices and perspectives into the present curriculum, we are able to set aside past differences and come together in sharing cultural differences through a safe and nurturing environment. </div><div>     &nbsp;<b>Breanna&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp; The effects of the colonial history of our nation are still greatly felt today. Educational anthropology played a role in the colonization of Canada, among other countries, and the sub-field of the discipline has the ability&nbsp;</div>
