University of Toronto Press: Toronto. 391-403.</b></div><div>Talal Asad’s introduction from <i>Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter </i>looks at the relationship between anthropology and colonialism. He discusses the “handmaiden of colonialism”, referring to anthropology being the handmaiden to colonialism. Asad believed that anthropology was born out of colonialism and these ethnocentric ideologies shaped the beginnings of the discipline. He writes that the discipline was created out of an unequal divide between first world countries and third world countries. Asad acknowledges the disparity between those who primarily dominate the study of anthropology and those who are the subjects leads to a greater power divide. This power struggle has shaped the discipline and must be always aware to anthropologists when conducting research. He writes “we then need to ask ourselves how this relationships has affected the practical pre-conditions of social anthropology; the uses to which its knowledge was put; the theoretical treatment of particular topics; the mode of perceiving and objectifying alien societies; and the anthropologists claim of political neutrality.” (Asad, 1973: 388). Asad’s article on colonialism and anthropology provides a blunt look at the deep ties between the two that can be hidden. His work is relevant to the research paper as it examines the impact of colonialism on anthropology worldwide. </div><div><b>Dyck, Noel. “Cultures, Communities and Claims: Anthropology and Native Studies in Canada”. From <i>Canadian Ethnic Studies. </i>1990. Vol. 22, Issue 3: 40-55.</b></div><div>Noel Dyck’s article looks at the emergence of Indigenous studies by anthropologists over the past 40 years. Research and ethical management surrounding how anthropologist conduct their work in Canada has increasingly changed and adapted over the last few decades. More protocols and consent has to be established before any ethnographic fieldwork begins. Dyck discusses how “the nature of anthropologists’ involvement with aboriginal communities and issues has been shifting as field researchers have been asked to intervene on behalf of native peoples when dealing with governments.” (Dyck 1990: 43). No more does the armchair anthropologist exist in Canada according to Dyck. Canadian anthropologists have taken on the role of advocates and speakers on behalf of their subjects. Anthropologists have begun to take an active role as agents in Indigenous communities and issues affecting them instead of remaining solely as outsiders looking in. Participatory research methodology has allowed anthropologists to become involved in publishing oral histories and conducting extensive interviews. This allows for a more insider’s perspective to be achieved during fieldwork. Anthropology in Canada has adapted to acknowledge Indigenous communities are not static and unchanging. Noel Dyck’s article provided a detailed and in depth examination of the relationship between Indigenous people and anthropologists. His work will be a helpful source in looking at the colonial ties to Canadian anthropology.</div><div><b>Dyck, Noel, and James B Waldram.&nbsp;<i>Anthropology, Public Policy, and Native Peoples in Canada</i>. 2014. McGill-Queen’s University Press: Montréal.&nbsp;</b></div><div>Noel Dyck and James B. Waldram examine the ties between Canadian anthropology and its Indigenous peoples. Dyck and Waldram divide their book on Indigenous issues into three subsections; focusing on historical perspectives on policy issues, followed by anthropological research and finally the anthropological involvement in Indigenous issues. Part three on anthropology’s hand in Indigenous policy looks at six individual case studies including anthropologist Julia Harrison. Anthropologists have faced tensions with Indigenous groups due to previous misrepresentations of groups in research. Although, the book discusses anthropologists working for Indigenous organizations can actually benefit these organizations for several reasons. These reasons include “political cohesion, operational knowledge of government, and policy research capacity.” (Dyck and Waldram 2014: 277). As Canadian anthropology is deeply tied to colonialism, anthropologists can use this history to better examine how to move away from a Eurocentric view by allowing marginalized groups to have a voice. This source is particularly helpful for writing the paper as it looks at the influences Indigenous studies have on anthropologists in Canada. The authors provide a comprehensive and in-depth look at the way anthropologists can influence Indigenous policy in Canada by providing examples.</div><div><b>Ervin, Alexander M, and Lorne Holyoak. “Applied Anthropology in Canada: Historical Foundations, Contemporary Practice and Policy Potentials.”&nbsp;2006. <i>Napa Bulletin</i>, Vol. 25, No. 1: 134–155.</b></div><div>Alexander Ervin and Lorne Holyoak’s article examines how Canadian history has shaped and influenced anthropology, specifically applied anthropology. The authors look at the history of applied anthropology in Canada and its relationship to Indigenous groups. Anthropologists Diamond Jenness and Harry Hawthorn worked closely with Indigenous groups and preservation of traditional ceremonies such as the sun dance. Canadian anthropology grew out of its connection to colonialism and as a result Indigenous groups were intertwined. Much anthropological work has been done on Indigenous peoples in Canada, allowing for a variety of perspectives. The article discusses well known examples of anthropologists working alongside Indigenous groups in Canada. Anthropologists in Canada have become increasingly involved in participatory research alongside Indigenous groups and advocating for improving quality of life for their subjects. The James Bay Hydroelectric project in the 1970’s is mentioned as a prime case of anthropologists able to study a group being relocated and the ramifications associated with this shift. They discuss how anthropologists in Canada have begun to understand Indigenous policy making and the issues surrounding it. Ervin and Holyoak provide an in depth examination of the emergence of Canadian anthropology becoming advocates for Indigenous rights and removing the colonial influence on the discipline.</div><div> <b>Hancock, Robert L.A. “Towards a Historiography of Canadian Anthropology”. <i>Readings for a History of Anthropological Theory</i>. 2014. University of Toronto Press: Toronto. pp. 30-43.</b></div><div>Robert L.A. Hancock’s article examines the historiography of Canadian anthropology. He first looks at the history of Canadian anthropology by breaking it down into four periods of development. These four periods were the missionary era, the amateur era, the national museum era, and the university era. Hancock discusses how these four periods shaped Canadian anthropology through work by anthropologists such as Franz Boas and Edward Sapir. He writes that Canadian anthropology has struggled to find its own identity but has been greatly shaped by colonialism. Canadian anthropology found its beginning in the missionary era with the work of Jesuit missionaries in what was known as New France. These missionaries wrote about the Indigenous groups in Canada from their perspective and began ethnographic field research. Hancock discusses some of the issues facing Canadian anthropology in biases and ethnocentrism that were rooted in colonization. His article is beneficial for the research paper in that it discusses the history of Canadian anthropology and its deep ties to colonialism and settler history in Canada.&nbsp;</div><div> <b>Park, Augustine S.J. “Settler Colonialism and the Politics of Grief: Theorising a Decolonising Transitional Justice for Indian Residential Schools”.

Park’s article looks at the creation of residential schools in Canada and the history of settler colonialism. As the author is a historian and not an anthropologist, they provide a more historical look at residential schools rather than an anthropological perspective. The article is useful for collecting background information on some of the key events in Canadian history that shaped the country and how anthropological work is conducted in Canada. As Indigenous groups in Canada are still are increasingly marginalized group and were historically forgotten or misrepresented in anthropology. As the discipline began it grew out of a largely European colonial perspective that underrepresented minority groups such as Indigenous groups in Canada and female perspectives in favour of the armchair anthropologist. This anthropologist tended to be a European male who allowed his own biases to influence the anthropological research being conducted. This source looks at settler colonialism from a historical perspective and provides a look at Canadian colonial history. This history heavily influenced anthropology in Canada through residential schools which the effects of are still being studied today.</div><div><b>Slaney, Frances. “Working For a Canadian Sense of Place(s): The Role of Landscape Painters in Marius Barbeau’s Ethnology”.

University of Wisconsin Press, Wisconsin. pp. 81-122.</b></div><div>In Richard Handler’s work on a history of anthropology, Frances M. Slaney writes about Marius Barbeau and his work with Indigenous groups and the idea of space and place. Slaney argues that Barbeau believed in an ethnically diverse and cross-cultural approach to research. “Rather than assume that all citizens would be equal and the same within a uniform state, Barbeau wanted to promote an appreciation of diversified local “colour” that would connect each citizen to numerous regional histories and culturally charged places.” (Slaney 2014: 84). She argues that Marius Barbeau was a pioneer in working to reduce any ethnocentric or prejudiced views of anthropologists during his time conducting research. Slaney’s article examines famous anthropologists who conducted work in Canada and left a lasting impression on how the discipline operates to this day. Both Franz Boas and Marius Barbeau practiced salvage anthropology and stressed the idea of diffusion and culture expanding. Slaney provides a look at anthropologists who helped to shape what is known as Canadian anthropology today and its identity.</div><div><b>Simpson, Audra. <i>Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across the Borders of Settler States. </i>2014. Duke University Press: Durham.&nbsp;</b></div><div>In Audra Simpson’s book,&nbsp; <i>Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across the Borders of Settler States </i>specifically chapter four, she examines the history of colonialism and anthropology with an Indigenous focus. Simpson discusses the dominant euro-centric presence in anthropology that romanticized the “noble savage”. She discusses prominent anthropologists such as Lewis Henry Morgan who conducted work on the Iroquois and some of his biases and misunderstandings he had about his subjects. Simpson looks at the extensive anthropological studies conducted on Iroquois people and issues of sovereignty in Canada. Chapter four of Simpson’s book examines the tight rope anthropologists must walk in conducting research on Indigenous groups. She discusses the difficulties she herself had when doing research as an Indigenous woman and an anthropologist. Audra Simpson’s work will be useful for the research paper as it looks at the impact colonialism has had on anthropologists in Canada. Her book provides an insider’s look at Canadian anthropology and its relations to Canada’s Indigenous people. The discipline has a tense history with its treatment of Indigenous people and Simpson is familiar with both sides and her viewpoint is an integral perspective when discussing this subject matter.&nbsp;</div><div>                       </div><div><b>Bibliography -- The Decolonization of Archaeological Practices</b></div><div><b>Decolonizing archaeological theory and practice</b></div><div>  Smith and Wobst discuss the field of archaeology as a colonialist endeavor, stating that one rarely considers non-Western approaches in caring for cultural heritage.

This methodology does not solely focus on decolonizing Canadian anthropology, but through the works selected we see how autoethnography has been deployed in a Canadian setting. Autoethnography, in essence, is a tool that shifts power away from colonizers, and facilitates the indigenization of anthropology and epistemology.&nbsp;    In “   Archaeology and Museums: Deconstruction   and examining the colonial effects on modern Canadian archaeology    ” section, it discusses the legal and reforms that have happened in archaeology and museums. In an age where colonial powers are no more reforms are needed to move anthropology and even archeaology out of the colonial framework. We are now in a post-colonial world where acts of repatriation are being done and ownership of indigenous artefacts are being challenged by both sides, indigenous and government.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The paper "The Colonial Past of Canadian Anthropology and Its Future" examines the history of Canadian anthropology with its influences from colonialism and specifically its relationship to Indigenous groups as a result.

Smith's book&nbsp;<i>Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{tuhiwai2013}</cite> is a well-known text that is not limited to anthropology, but that identifies different ways that research can be conducted by and with Indigenous peoples in ways that respect Indigenous needs and rights. </div><div>In a Canadian context, UBC anthropologist Charles Menzies has suggested a list of strategies for ethnographic research conducted "with, for, and among Indigenous peoples"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{menzies2001reflections}</cite>. </div><div>Central to both of these works is the premise that research must be truly collaborative from its inception, with research questions and priorities set in association with local communities, instead of operating in an extractive or merely consultative mode.

While anthropology  has greatly shifted away from its initial colonial ideals, it can be argued  that anthropology is inadvertently still colonial. Unfortunately, Canadian anthropology  is no exception to this pattern. Challenging these colonial values can be a difficult task. Throughout this essay, autoethnography, which is an  individual’s study or account of their own culture, will be examined as a  potential remedy to colonialism in anthropology. This will be done by looking  at how autoethnography challenges conventional anthropology’s physical  presence, how it can give a voice to informants, and how autoethnography intersects with <b>public anthropology</b> to deflect colonial values. To supplement this discussion, the autoethnographic works of Robert  F. Murphy, Julie Cruikshank, and Joel Martineau will be examined. Following  this, several common criticisms of autoethnography will be disputed. Over the  course of this essay it will be argued &nbsp;that autoethnography is an ideal means of  decolonization, physically and epistemologically. While this methodology does  not specifically target Canadian anthropology, some Canadian autoethnographic  works have been selected to show how it has decolonized Canadian anthropology.&nbsp;To understand how to challenge the presence of colonialism in anthropology we must first understand how anthropology has been colonial in the past.                                          &nbsp;</div><div>Central to the discipline of anthropology is fieldwork. &nbsp;Tullio Maranhão goes as far as to say that  fieldwork is the defining feature of the “anthropologist’s métier”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Maranhao1986}</cite>.  While fieldwork has laid the foundation of modern anthropological theory and  practice, colonial undercurrents can often be found, rendering some methods of fieldwork  problematic. Aleksandar Bošković and Thomas Hylland Eriksen highlight how western  anthropology is often colonial in nature because  it focuses on foreign cultures who are not in a position to resist an unwanted presence&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Boskovic.Erkison2013}</cite>. Essentially, anthropology has been colonial as it has synthesized inimical fieldwork with an interest in foreign cultures, and through this has reinforced colonial  power balances. Epitomizing the colonial themes encapsulated in fieldwork are  Marius Barbeau and Bronislaw Malinowski. A brief examination of the work of these anthropologists will draw attention to how autoethnography can be used  to decolonize anthropological fieldwork and methodology. It is  important to note that these anthropologists were chosen not for their  anachronistic nature, but because their fieldwork, while prolific and greatly  influential, was harmful to the cultures they studied.&nbsp;</div><div>Marius Barbeau, a Canadian salvage ethnographer, reinforces a colonial power balance through his fieldwork. In the early 20th century Barbeau collected and archived Indigenous cultures that he believed were on the brink of extinction. Through his preservation efforts Barbeau assumed the role of a cultural curator, where he arbitrated the (in)authentic. This method of fieldwork is colonial as it polarizes power between the Indigenous people and the anthropologist. Barbeau often disregarded the information locals provided to him, deeming that their cultural insight was inferior to his. Through this Barbeau creates a dichotomous power relationship, where he is the authoritative figure on a culture despite his brief immersion into it, and that because of this he controlled what was genuine. In short, Barbeau distorted and dismissed contemporary culture by deciphering its authenticity through his “intuition”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nurse2011}</cite>. Despite his problematic fieldwork, Barbeau made great contributions to archiving culture and championed early anthropology’s strive to salvage culture perceived to be at risk. As mentioned, Barbeau was a Canadian anthropologist, helping provide an example of how Canadian anthropology has been colonial.</div><div>Bronislaw Malinowski’s&nbsp;<i>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Malinowski1922}</cite> is another example of the colonial nature of anthropological fieldwork. While not Canadian in any sense, Malinowski's work further shows how anthropological methodology can be interpreted as colonial. Diverging from Barbeau’s power dichotomy, Malinowski’s fieldwork has a colonial undercurrent through the physical presence encouraged by&nbsp;<b>participant observation</b>. Malinowski advocated that anthropologists need to immerse themselves in the cultures they study. While this approach was progressive in contrast to its contemporaries, it reinforced a colonial presence in the cultures being studied. In “The Hermeneutics of Participant Observation”, Maranhão states that Indigenous populations fear anthropologists as they “do not know the powers [t]he[y] can unleash, but who have learned about the impact the colonial authority, the missionary, or the tourist can have over their community”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Maranhao1986}</cite>. In other words, the presence of an anthropologist can bring discomfort and even fear to a community. This is alluded to by Malinowski himself when he states: “they finished by regarding me as part and parcel of their life, a necessary evil or nuisance, mitigated by donations of tobacco”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Malinowski1922}</cite>. Despite eventually becoming a part of everyday life, it is clear that Malinowski was an invasive presence. Pertinent to the colonial roots of fieldwork is a quote from David MacDougall, an ethnographic film maker, who writes that “if not in his personal demeanor, then in the significance of his working method, he inevitably reaffirms the colonial origins of anthropology”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{McDougall2003}</cite>. While the works of these anthropologists have contributed greatly to current in anthropology, they reinforced problematic fieldwork methods. </div><div>Autoethnography offers a unique and polymorphous remedy to some of these issues, allowing a possible path for decolonizing anthropology.&nbsp;Central to the discussion of how to decolonize anthropology is the work of Mary Louise Pratt, who establishes a useful definition for the term “autoethnography”. Pratt states that autoethnography is when “colonized subjects undertake to represent themselves in ways that engage with the colonizers own terms”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pratt1991}</cite>. This definition provides context for the preceding works and how they can be seen as autoethnographic.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One central way that autoethnography decolonizes anthropology is through its subversive methodologies. One such work  that challenges the concept of the anthropologist as an authoritative third party is the work of Robert F. Murphy. Murphy's work is deeply emotional, tragic, and insightful, but for pertinence his work must be briefly summarized for its methodology. The Body Silent is an autoethnographic work, published in 1987, that charts Murphy’s transition into paralysis, and the social effects it has had on his life as an anthropologist and professor.&nbsp; In&nbsp;<i>The Body Silent</i>&nbsp;there is a merging of personal experience with research and theory, which creates a powerful anthropological work. This work is subversive, as rather than following patterns of western anthropology, focusing on foreign cultures with an etic approach, Murphy takes an introspective approach of his own culture, fusing <b>emic </b>and <b>etic </b>perspectives by using “inner space to explore the structure of selfhood and sentiment”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Murphy2001}</cite>. Indirectly this approach also removes what might be seen as an intrusive presence from an indigenous community. Murphy shows how the transition of denizen to subject can be fluid and unobtrusive, allowing for the study of physical impairment, or other aspects of ones own culture without the need&nbsp; for a colonial presence. Murphy decolonizes anthropology by showing that it is not solely a tool for learning about the "other".</div>
