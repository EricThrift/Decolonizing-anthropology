<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Salvage ethnography also played a specific role in Canadian Archaeology, where the archaeologist by the name of Harlan I. Smith undertook the first systematic archaeological fieldwork in southern British Columbia.&nbsp; Smith led three archaeological field expeditions as a part of the&nbsp;<i>Jesup North Pacific Expedition</i> directed by Franz Boas.&nbsp; Throughout his fieldwork, Smith kept in close contact with Boas through letters and sending postcards.&nbsp; The letters contained detailed accounts on his field practices embodying many issues that archaeologists still face today such as themes of cultural conflict, ethics of practice, degree of community involvement, and colonial attitudes.&nbsp; An example of this is shown in the following figure where Smith explains to Boas how the Indigenous community is upset about the removal of bones.&nbsp; Smith writes with hope that they will be willing to give him the bones so that they can be shipped to New York for further study &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{carlson2005}</cite>.</div><div>  </div>
